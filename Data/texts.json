            "1.) How do I use a boat?":{
                "text":"You will need the **Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.8**. application to run boats. You can download the application from our portal site, https://adventurequest.life/, instructions to do so are in #how-to-find-boats if you need any help. Once you do that, simply download a boat and load it.\n\n> Bo(a)t -> Misc -> Load Boat [ NOT Load Boat (command) ]\nHow to load a boat: \n\n",

            },
            "2.) How do I edit something in a bot?":{
                "text":"Double click the line you want to edit, and change whatever you want to change. If you want to make a mass edit, just open the .gbot file with Notepad (from its folder), and use a quick Find+Replace.\n"
            },
            "3.) I downloaded a bot and it isn't loading! What do I do?":{
                "text":"If you downloaded a bot and tried loading it, but nothing happened once you loaded the .gbot file, chances are, you're on an outdated version of Grimoire. Download **Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7** from #how-to-download-bots and try again. If it still doesn't work, head over to #boating-help-chat and describe your issue in detail.\n\n"
            },
            "4.) My screen became black! What happened?":{
                "text":"If a boat turns black, chances are, it has the lag killer feature enabled, which reduces lag significantly. Don't worry, the boat is still running in the background, this is just done to increase farming efficiency by killing lag.\n\n> To turn it off while the bot is running:\n> Boat -> Options -> Untick Lag Killer\n> To turn it off while the bot is not running:\n> Boat -> Options -> Untick Lag Killer -> Tick Enable Options Without Starting Boat\n\nIt is highly recommended to leave it on whilst boating, as it enhances the speed of the boat.\n"
            },
            "5.) My bot keeps disconnecting? How do I fix it?":{
                "text":"Most good bots will have a `Set Bot Delay: <number>` command at the top. If it's `Set Bot Delay: 0`, delete it, and add a `Set Bot Delay: 10` command in its place.\n> Boat -> Misc -> Boat Delay -> Type in 10 -> Set Boat Delay\nIf it's another number, double click the command and increase that number by 5 or 10. \n\nIncreasing the Boat Delay will make the boat very slightly slower, but will also prevent disconnections from occurring as frequently, so keep increasing the Boat Delay by 5 or 10 until you hit that sweet spot where you stop disconnecting. This usually happens at 10 for most people, but some have to go up to 25.\n"
            },
            "6.) This bot isn't working properly... what happened...?":{
                "text":"If the bot you downloaded isn't doing what you think it should be doing, check its instruction manual if applicable. Also reference the wiki and try to find out what it's doing. If neither of these work (or there's simply too much to look up on the wiki), feel free to ask in #boating-help-chat.\n"
            },
            "7.) Why is this item not dropping? What is the drop rate of the item?":{
                "text":"Oftentimes when this question is asked, the item has a high drop rate, however, certain external factors prevent it from dropping. In order to remedy this, use any or all of the following golden rules:\n\n **1)** Log out and log back in.\n**2)** Change your server, preferably to a less popular one like Twig or Twilly.\n**3)** Change your map, preferably to a private room if you're in a public room.\n**4)** Clear your browser cache. A cluttered cache may prevent items from dropping.\n**5)** Change your game. This one works the best. Trust me.\n\n"
            },
            "8.) Why is my \"_pro\" boat using Potions? Will it get me banned?":{
                "text":"The skillsets used by the _pro boats have a provision for potions should you need them for a certain grind. The same boats often use potions such as Felicitous Philtre to greatly increase soloing speed or Potion of Evasion to allow you to consistently solo hard hitting monsters wherever applicable and also, feasible. You won't get kicked or banned for spamming Skill 5: Potions because the game treats it as a player spamming potions despite not having them; the error warning is just there to alert players that using Skill 5 does nothing when a potion is not equipped. Please do not remove Skill 5: Potions on these boats or you will mess up its flow and cause bugs. Just leave it as it is.\n\n"

            "11.) What is the shop id for <insert shop name here>?":{
                "text":"First, wiki the shop and find out whether it comes from the game menu or not.\n\n**If it does:** Nice, try loading it and hope you don't get banned.\n\n**If it does not:** then find out which map it is in. Then ask yourself can I join this map?\n\n**If you can join the map:** Then nice, join that map and load the shop. YOU HAVE TO JOIN THE SAME MAP A SHOP IS IN FOR IT TO LOAD!!!\n\n**If you can't join the map for any reason:** Then don't bother loading it cause it won't load.\n\n"

            "13.) <insert item name here> hasn't dropped yet? Is the drop rate really low??":{
                "text":"It'll drop. The drop rate scales with the amount of complaining.\n\n||Unless you forgot to whitelist it <:KekU:804648765612228648>||\n\n"
