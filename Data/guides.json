I find this can be done best by keeping the mixture temperature at about 70-80 degrees. Use the red button to increase the heat or the blue button to freeze the runestone and stop it from overheating. The harder the rune, the easier it is for it to overheat. Sometimes, a fireball will not hit the runestone and instead set the room on fire, putting the meter at 100 - you cannot avoid this. Similarly, the ice may not cool down the runestone and could actually put your meter at -30. If this happens, you may as well restart because you won't lose any reagents for it.",
