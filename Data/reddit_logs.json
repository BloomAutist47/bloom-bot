We value your safety and privacy above anything else. To download bots from this subreddit, go over to our portal website: [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/)\n\n**Firstly, you will need to download the Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7 application.** Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jozmg9/download_grimoire_38_pro_v177/) for more info on how to edit or use it. This is an exclusive service offered by our subreddit.\n\nOnce you have that, click Download Boots and search up the boot you want to run on the portal. Click on its name to download it. If you see a boot post on the subreddit, you may download it from there as well. Note that boots posted are approved by the moderators of this subreddit, and hence will guarantee their quality and safety. If you download a boot from a post in this subreddit, you will find virus scans as well. Make sure to upvote any boot that helps you!\n\nIf you're having trouble running a boot or would like to learn how to make edits in order to optimize it, use the [Grim 101 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9uke1qa0pzjAOTMUkasGR7Rqsz0fdOwdV0BaEzz0/edit) by /u/DragonTaryth. If you need assistance with a boot you downloaded, feel free to make a post on the subreddit, comment on the post you downloaded it from, or message us in one of our chat rooms. If you're posting on the subreddit, it helps a lot to take a screenshot of the part of your bot that isn't working. Just use a snipping tool.",

Moderators will go over your boot and make changes as necessary to optimize it as much as possible, and then upload it on the portal and send you a copy of the boot. When you have this copy, you may make a boot post on the subreddit, describing exactly what your boot does and instructions to run it and the like. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC4ceYgz8-ltXDKGw8hSPZIzywzwS3Mk4npYvCMiP7c/edit?usp=sharing) to find the boot post format and some other basic tips for boot makers to make your and our lives easier. If you have the permissions to, do make your comments section a live chat so it's easier to ask for any help needed.\n\nDo **NOT** post boot files on the subreddit. Doing so will be considered as a violation of the safety and privacy of our users and will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you post at least 5 good boots (before moderator edits), you can apply for a moderator position. You'll have limited permissions, but will gain more with contributions to our subreddit.",

You can also add the **Questions and Help** flair to allow people to immediately understand that you need help. If you can, make the comments section of your post a live chat so it's easier for us to diagnose and troubleshoot your problem.

            "image": null,
            "text": "**1. Why is my Boot not loading?** \n\nIf your boot isn't loading, this means you're using an outdated version of Grimoire. All new and recently made bots are made specifically for the latest versions of Grimoire, known as Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7. You can get the latest version of Grimoire from the Portal Site.\n\n**2. Boot keeps disconnecting?!**\n\nThis means your Boot Delay is very low. Most boots will have a \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command at the very top. You want to replace this with higher bot delay command. To do so, just head over to:\n\n    Misc -> Boot Delay -> (Change the number in the box to 10) -> Select the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command -> Hold Ctrl and Click \"Set Boot Delay\" -> Remove the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command.\n\nYou may now edit this command to a higher value such as 20 or 30 (by double clicking and replacing 10 with the desired number) if you're still disconnecting, but don't go too high as that would make the boot slow and inefficient. Some boots have a \"Set Boot Delay: 1\" command and those boots can be edited directly by double clicking.\n\n**3. Boot not working?**\n\nIf a boot isn't working, read the instructions on how to use the boot once again, if they are provided (they may be on the boot post on the subreddit or in the zip file in which you download your boots) before asking for help. Chances are you'll find your answer there. Furthermore, please take the time to read a guide on whatever item you're farming so you'll know exactly what the boot is supposed to be doing. If a boot stops without giving you the item you're farming, chances are it farmed all the required reagents and is waiting for you to turn in the quest yourself.",

You must have Grimoire 3.8+ PRO downloaded in order to run a boot from this subreddit.\n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD GRIMOIRE 3.8+ PRO:**\n\nGrimoire 3.8+ PRO is only supported by Windows. If you are a MacOS user, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPf1yVywKPk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n**To Download Grimoire 3.8+ PRO, you'll need either WinRAR or 7zip.** Once you have those, head over to our portal site, [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/), and click on **\"Download Grimoire\"**, which should automatically download it for you. Once you download it, you'll be able to run any boot you download from the same portal site. Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jghh66/download_boots/) for further information on how to download and run boots if you're new.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Grimoire 3.8+ PRO Exclusive Features:**\n\n1. **Selecting Multiple Commands:** Simply drag your pointer across various commands\n2. **Copying and Pasting Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+C to copy it and Ctrl+V to paste it below your selected line.\n3. **Duplicating Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+D to duplicate them.\n4. **Quickly Moving Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move them up or down respectively. You can hold Ctrl+Up/Down to move them several lines above or below also.\n5. **Adding Commands to a certain part of the boot:** Tired of adding a command and having it show up at the very bottom of the command list? Just go to the line above which you want to add the command, hold Ctrl, and add the command. For example, if you want to add a Kill \\* command above line 53 of your boot, select line 53, hold Ctrl, and add the Kill \\* command. It will show up in your desired position. (Actually a 3.8+ feature but very worth mentioning.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Advanced Commands (ignore if you're just a casual user):**\n\n**Index Commands:** Most lines in your command list in Grimoire 3.8+ PRO will have numbers next to them indicating which line it is, known as their index. You can add a command that makes the boot go to a specific index; or a command that goes a few Indexes up or down. You'll find Index commands in the Misc tab.\n\n**Integer Commands:** You can use a command to assign an integer value to a variable if you want the boot to remember information. Integer values can also be increased or decreased using commands. For example, if you want the boot to remember if the player is a member or not, you can make the boot go to a member only map like /nulgath, wait a few seconds, and set some variable (say, m) value as 1. Later on, if you want the boot to do something specific based on whether or not you're a member, you can add If Statement saying something along the lines of:\n\n    m == 1\n    Goto label: MEMBER\n\nInteger commands can be found in the Misc tab as well, and their If Statements can be found by going to the If Statement section and selecting Misc on the first line. You'll see Int is / Int is not / Int is greater than / Int is less than. There's a lot of stuff you can pull off with Indexes and Integers if used correctly.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut wait, that's not all!

(compared to SWOT) Reducing damage taken  only work for itself\n\n\\-no dodge bonus. I don\u2019t know when will I met a boss that one shot me in face but I know those exist in endgame/event\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSWOT\n\n\\+dont need to watch for skill's stack\n\n\\+5's 80% hit chance ensure 3 dont miss\n\n\\+dot make killing 'lower' HP bosses faster I guess (also something else doing damage if 3 misses)\n\n\\+More versatile\n\n?have 25% endurance.

            "text": "Hi guys, \nI can't help but notice some of you people don't really know or cannot tell the difference between item's rarity tags. So, in order to avoid further arguments and insulting, I will try to explain as narrowly and quickly as possible. So, there we go:\n\nSeasonal Rare rarity - items tagged with this are returning items; in other words, they come back into the game some time after they're taken out of the game ( most usual occasion, annually ). In aqwwiki.wikidot.com ( official AQW wiki ) site, these items are tagged with pink Seasonal tag. In short, if you see someone with an item, that's tagged as Seasonal, and you know for fact you can't get it now, don't feel bad, it will come back sooner or later, just keep checking  aq.com/gamedesignnotes :)\n\nRare rarity - now items tagged with such a rarity are going to be taken out of shops/monster or boss drop lists/quest reward lists. If you see an item pop up with a \"Rare Rarity\" tag in, say, Featured Shop, and you like said item, I'd strongly suggest you buy it, because, chances are, it will be gone in a couple of weeks. In AQW wiki, these items are tagged with a green Rare tag. If you find a guy with, say, a really good looking sword, and you check his char page, click on an item, go to wiki page, and it's tagged with a green Rare tag, you can forget that item completely, because you won't be able to get it anymore, unless you have it in your bank/you sold it and it was AC tagged ( that way, it's in your Buy Back shop )/you have a spare Item of Donated Awesomeness that you could use to get that item.\n\nAny other rarity items are pretty much available at any time that you may or may not wish to get it. Want to grab, say, a Phoenix Blade as a drop from Red Dragon in /lair? Go ahead. Either today, tomorrow, or two months from now, it will always be in it's drop list. \n\nHowever, there are ( though, very rare, but still very much real ) some items, tagged with \"Awesome Rarity\", \"Legendary Rarity\", etc. rarity tags, that, in reality, have gone rare. But these, as I stated before, are quite an uncommon case, so they can be called exceptions. In order to always be well informed about such items, I'd suggest you read Game Design Notes, Facebook or Twitter pages, etc. \n\nOne more rarity tag ( quite an infrequent tag, but it's becoming more and more abundant, and I will try to explain why further ahead ) is \"Pseudo-Rare\" tag. Such a tag is nonexistant directly in-game, but you will come across one if you browse in AQW wiki for some time. \"Pseudo-Rare\" tagged items are, essentially, also \"Rare\", although they are still available to a certain group of people. Items with such a rarity tag in wiki are ( or, to some people, WERE ) available by completing quests or from specific item-locked shops, that require certain rare items, like Infernal Caladbolg, buying them from a certain pet that holds a shop, like Collection Chests ( and, as there are more and more Collection Chests coming into the game once every while, \"Pseudo-Rare\" item tag is going to be more and more abundant and frequent, as stated above ), or a specific quest ( from a pet ) reward. Now these special items, pets and Collection Chests are \"Rare\", which means they are no longer obtainable in the game. However, the portion of people who still have said pets, can, in theory, still obtain these items, hence the \"Pseudo\" part of their tag. A quick example - the original Thanatos armor is \"Pseudo-Rare\", meaning that it's still available to people, but only those, who have the original \"Rare\" Paragon Pet and can still access it's quests. Another note on this topic - \"Pseudo-Rare\" tag in AQW wiki is a very similar, though lighter shade of green than \"Rare\" tag, due to it being very closely tied to items with a \"Rare\" tag. \n\nHope this helped some people understand how item rarities work in game :) Have a good one, fellas!",

            "text": "A timeline is a graphic representation of the passage of time as a line, or so I've heard (or searched up). AQW has some issues with time and I'm gonna tell you why. This will be a shorter post than normal, so maybe someone will actually read the whole thing. Who knows.\n\n1. Time doesn't start when we start. Or does it?One key issue with games that have self-insert protagonists is when a setting isn't properly established at the beginning of the game. You'll notice that if you actually head back to the AQW tutorial and play through it again, we just happen to be at the castle at the right time during the attack, which is the start of our adventure. Later you find out we're some powerful dragon dude who actually reset the universe and was living in between time. There's a huge, I daresay massive disconnect there. If we were the literal cause of the reset of the original universe, then when were we born as a hero into the world, how did we grow up in this world, what age are we, and were we alive during important events such as the rise of Sepulchure or the Queen's death or other things like that?\n2. In the year of whatever year they wanna say.Whenever someone mentions 2021, the first thing that would come to your mind is the year this is written in, 2021 A.D. of Earth. Now if you were to say that same phrase on Lore, well it couldn't mean the same thing as here, could it now? Lore is a completely different world that may seem similar in terms of time cycles and seasons to our Earth, but it has a lot more unknown elements affecting it. Simply put, you can't just say this is Frostval 2017, because 2017 doesn't refer to a year in which Lore exists; Lore isn't Earth so it doesn't necessarily follow our history. AQW has basically no past setting, or if it does, it struggles a ton to actually explain it well. You might brush over it, but since there's almost no records of official timelines being put together for the game, or even an estimate of how old the world is, it doesn't make sense for it to be 2021 in Lore.\n3. Seasonals for the seasonal season, or so I've seen.Seasonal releases indicate seasons, which indicates time change, which indicates a rotating axis, and yada yada basic planet stuff that most people can Google. Assuming that seasons come and go similarly to how they do on Earth, since they haven't given me a reason to believe differently, that means there must be a period of a year in Lore between a specific seasonal event, give or take a few days. This comes back to my last point, if there are obviously years passing between seasonal events, then when did this all start and in what year are we in now, that these traditions are customary?\n4. Side releases with a side of....release.Still on the years topic, if I went and helped the lunarmancer at Luna Cove (which was in the summer of 2015), then I decided to visit the Throne of Darkness (in the summer of 2016), does it matter what I did first? Not really, since they're independent from the main story, which is helpful but also a hindrance. By detaching certain characters completely from the main story and releasing an event at a certain time, it's hard to gauge when exactly that event happened without obvious cues in the release itself. Luna Cove doesn't really go anywhere after all, and there are heaps upon heaps of side releases that serve as some sort of weekly filler that I don't know where to place because of two reasons. One is that they just don't seem that important and feature characters who disappear into thin air in the next week. The other is that the hero, being a self-insert, is literally incapable of character development, lest we change our jovial, foolhardy attitude we've had for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12ish years now. You can't really see much reason in these releases, and can frankly place them anywhere on this hypothetical timeline, since it doesn't even develop the side characters shown in the release.\n5. Chronomancer? Nonomancer.By adding people who can just woah magically learn how to travel across time to change it however they please, you basically just mess up any semblance of normality you had with your already unstable timeline. Remember that part where Kezeroth got frozen in ice for a really long time (still doesn't indicate when the world was made btw) cause a chrono just popped in and said yes why not let's do this? Remember the part where they for no absolute reason other than a cool boss, insinuated that time has a reachable end and chronomancers can apparently beat the monster at the end? Attempt to recall the sheer annoyance of a Chronomancer whisking us away to a future we know nothing about, only to die to a wayward spear and leaving us behind to get home somehow. Does that not cause any sort of temporal instability in the universe, or was it just convenient to have Artix dead and we can brush it off with dragon of time powers that we can't use btw? It just hurts whenever they introduce random chronomancers into the story, which is why the only one with a decent backstory, Xeven, is probably the best. And she still has her issues.\n6. Lastly, why make us a dragon of time?Sorry if you didn't know about this part but I assume you've gotten this far with a few spoilers. We caused the reset of the universe by dying, and apparently we're getting our powers back for no reason, because that's what we totally need right now. Not even by making us the dragon, but by making us regain powers we literally shouldn't even know about due to them being in a past life which we had previously forgotten, they can just excuse anything that straight up should not make sense when dealing with time in relation to our character. Stumbled upon a village that's trapped in a timelock? Dragon of Time. Skilled Chronomancer tries to temporarily freeze us? Dragon of Time. Need more time in the mirror realm to stop a crisis? Sure I'll just freeze the entire universe indefinitely. It's like a gimmick that they don't even know how to use exactly, so they just apply it like a band-aid when attention needs to be diverted.\n\nBut enough of that. The basic summary is that if you're reading this paragraph, you either read everything and are considering it, didn't read any of it because you didn't feel like it, or you read here and there and get the basic gist of what I mean. The issue now is actually getting them to notice that there are longstanding issues with the world they've failed to build, and maybe patching those issues up is a job for now, or the next game.",

            "text": "I'm not a longtime player of the game, only happening to start up my account in 2014 after suddenly remembering the game existing due to a well-placed ad. But over the past 6ish years, I've had some fond memories with it and some not so fond ones. To make things clear and if you know me, you'll know this, I'm one of the least cosmetic focused people I know. Not to say I haven't purchased AC items here and there but I just don't really focus on obtaining items I know I won't use, which is why I won't be making arguments about cosmetic quality over the years. ~~That and I don't wanna reopen the Hollowborn discussions.~~ To put it short, here are a few of the issues I've had with the game itself and maybe a little as to how we got here.   \n\n\n1. Release quality. Let me paint you a picture. You had just gotten home from whatever education system you were involved in at the time and decided to boot up AQW. The year happened to be 2014 and you were excited to finally end the chaos saga and have the final showdown with Drakath. As you traversed up the mountain, the excellent synopsis of the events of the saga flashed you back to when you played each part the first time, obtaining and grinding different classes along the way. When you finally reach the summit, the slew of cutscenes unlike any other begin.   \nNow this is a finale of a longstanding saga yes, but the releases these days don't seem to have that sort of magic and effort put into them. I could even go more recent, into something as comical and enjoyable as Swaggy's Chateau and compare it to this year's recent Valentine's release, of which I can barely remember the name of. Sure the plushies were cute and frankly don't deserve to be bound to that forgotten seasonal, but you get my point; there just used to be something enjoyable about all releases, instead of them just being AC advertisements. Maybe it's just my perception changing as I grow up, or something else.  \n\n2. Music quality. Remember the Throne of Darkness. If you talk about music in AQW in any capacity, ToD is bound to come up in the conversation, as it's one of, if not straight, the best (and only) soundtracks in all of the game. Even individually, the atmosphere of each of the songs fit extremely well for the characters that they're related to, and I genuinely want to extend my thanks to Ghost for making such amazing pieces. But as they say, all good things must come to an end. AQW and DF have a history of mooching songs off each other, but after a while, you just hear the same old recycled tunes in different zones. Not saying every update has to have handcrafted pieces, but it has been a while since there's been a new one. Doomwood 3 surprisingly is the last instance where I can recall a song that wasn't previously used in the game. Or none of this applies to you because you don't even play the game with sounds on because they still haven't added a slider function.   \n\n3. Writing quality. I'll be honest. I've attempted to play every release in this game that's not just farming for stuff and I don't know if I regret it or not. I get a kick out of playing old side releases and making jokes about them to others, but there is just something different when you compare them over the past decade. I don't really know how to explain this but it seems as if the formula has changed, from having a linear storyline to a more cohesive one, and that's affected how we interact with characters. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just take a look at the >!Malgor saga as of now and you'll see some things.\nWe've gained a total of 4 allies, counting the Crownsreach Chaos Crowd as one of them with Drakath at the helm, and foiled multiple of Malgor's plots to date. The issue is, this story sort of lacks a clear direction, as Malgor has just become a villain who, like the Queen used to, orders some unnamed general to take care of things, unless you're Xing. He gets up in the mirror realm to do some stuff but frankly that entire story was a mess, tasking us to head back to the mirror realm to beat up Gravelyn who somehow got corrupted by Malgor + co. who got access to the mirror realm to find the Amulet of Order, a classic Macguffin that's so much of one it doesn't even have a design. This results in us assembling the Avengers from the past in the mirror realm to fight a threat that Brentan ends up somehow casting an all-powerful spell that literally banishes all unknown elements of the realm from the realm. And none of this has any short-term effects on the realm's instability. Amazing how convoluted one battle can seem, when the related narratives don't flow together well. Complicated isn't necessarily better, and if you play through even one Chaos saga story, or heck even Extriki's story, you'll notice that while the plot is linear and a lot simpler, it's still valid and interesting due to the characters and enemies themselves. Basic actions performed well can outdo extravagant ones performed poorly.\n!<\n\nBut yeah. In short, I could say the game sucked less than it did now, or I'm just not finding it as enjoyable as it used to be. I still do hope I could help in the future. If that's even possible. Let me know what topics other than cosmetics you find issue with. If it was about looks, we'd be here the whole year.",

We don't want another AQ3D. A game that didn't take off because most of the original crowd of AQW stayed in the game they had lots of progress in, money spent. Attachment.\n\nThis set up AQ3D to be harder to be successful as opposed to a adventure quest world's mobile port. Where lots of players will be carried over to start populating the game and getting it recognised. \n\n\nAlso there will not be much content for you at launch of AQ2D. they are porting Eveything. Having to grind again is going to maintain the playerbase early on, increase the game player count and popularity and will be a good way to keep the community busy until further new progress is made to the game. There will be nothing new and you will be moaning about that. We don't want the game to be inactive.\n\n\n If you want AQ2D to be as uccessful, popular and improve progress resetting is a must to bring eveybody back, as there will be not much to do if you have already gotten key items.",

But the Nulgath items are far away more interesting for me and the others, Nulgath like farmable items/class its my goal, so anyone that wish some new active player and want a support like player just Pm me or leave the nicknames so I can add someone, preference for a guild with discord, and I'm a Brazilian player so if there's a Br guild I'd love to join, (S\u00e9rio mano se algum br tem uma guild relativamente ativa chama n\u00f3is), thanks for the attention and Battleon!!",

I read up on and downloaded AQLite, which seems awesome so far, but idk.

Do they not realize, nobody is using the shit armors/weapons/capes/helms  they release because they are shit. I feel like AE doesn't listen to our feedback at all bcuz if they did, it wouldn't be so boring. \n\nOnce you criticize AE and their artists work on Twitter they take it as being rude and get all butthurt. Like no, Im just telling you \"your armor sucks and I'd rather you not waste time releasing it\". Artists like Darkon, Lae (with his trash hollowborn items that nobody wants) and Crulon honestly are used to ppl agreeing with their trash releases but me, I see past all the bullshit. Then wanna re-skin and recolor everything just to give us content, like bruh you could've used that time to come up with new ideas. I find it hard to believe that AE had months to plan for Nulgath Bday and could only come up with shitty seasonals and bad armors, same with dage, we got nothing new but the (tbh a very trash evolved) Darkside armor. Let's not forget how AE rather show love to a game (Aq3d) that is complete garbage and looks like 90's graphics, rather than improve their main money maker (AQW). GTA San Andreas graphics are better than Aq3d and Aq3d was made recently \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nNow let's talk AC's, there's literally no reason to buy them, or Membership. Nothing cool to spend it on and no perks other than member only quests.\n\nThen AE has the nerve to come up with a daily release system, which I'm thankful for but let be honest, once you see the tweet about the daily drops, it's not even worth logging on for. So tired of the childish helms and armors, give us something God Like or Angelic, don't wanna walk around looking like my account is owned by a 7yr old. Legion Titan still doesn't have a sword to match the armor, which they could take the sword from Legion Titans cloak and use that, but no they'd rather release unfinished sets. DragonBlade of nulgath still doesn't have a dragon like armor to match it.\n\nMe and my 8yr old brother could honestly draw better weapons then AE's artists. Guys if I missed anything let me know down below.",

It helped me throuhh childhood depression, when I used to be bullied in fourth grade.\n\nAnd it's kind of sad to see, that it's almost dead nowdays. \nSo just out of fun, I made a list, of what would need to change, to make the game poular, playable and fun, in 2021\n\nLet's start with the one,that personally bothers me the most :\n Nearly impossible farms, and required grinding : grinding should not be required to be a descently strong player. \nSome hardcore, god tier items, like VHL, LR,NSoD or BLoD would still be hard to get, but for example, I don't see a reason, for Shaman to require a grind. The thing is, that currently there's three types of players : people who are underpowered because they leak the time and patience to kill the same goddamn monster 69420911 times, the people who actually grind (~1% I feel like) and botters, who are just like the first category, but are overpowered, because they do get those OP items. \nAnd this is very wrong. The casual players NEED to be buffed. That itself, would stop at least a few people from botting. \n\nThe second great factor I think that needs a change is items. To be honest,minus the ultra hard to get NSOD and BLOD, items are just for the looks mainly. And this is dumb. Every weapon would need an impact on damage, PRE-ENCHANCEMENT,  ENH should only amplify it. At the current moment,most weapons are the same (minus damage range and looks),and this is a big issue, thag causes the game to be very boring. \nSame for armor. And I'm not talking about the class. The actual armor. That should impact defense and maybe even speed.\nThat would make the game much more complex, wich it needs, it's too simple.\n\nThis one would be enough to get me back into the game. But I'm courios, do you guys also have toughts like this? Can this be our AQ2D wishlist?",
