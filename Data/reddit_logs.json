            "image": null,
            "text": "It's as simple as the title says. AQW has trash punishment for cheating and something needs to change. A permanent loss of account for mentioning cheating vs a 3 day for actually doing it? I know there are some AE staff who check this place so what the heck is up with this? You mean to tell me I could mention the word bot in game and be met with a worse punishment than the actual action? If that isn't pathetic, I don't know what is. You punish the action not the word. Who even thought this was okay? If actual cheating gets you a temporary time out, maybe that's why nearly everyone does it? No wonder people treat the game as a joke. \n\nI'll offer a possible change. AQW is a game where items you have play a big role in how good your account is so get rid of the whole temporary account timeout and remove illegitimately gained gear and also restrict the account from accessing the actual quests to farm for said gear for a yet to be determined period. Simply put, if you bot, you can't farm for a while. \n\nIn addition to this, make grinds less annoying. The DoT class farming was done right. You had to work with others to finish and near everyone had a decent time with it. If all endgame grinds were like this why would anyone bot? You'd be doing everyone a favor. Instead we are almost always given these endgame grinds which are the crazed antics of a lunatic shoved at our faces. Kill this 1 million hp boss that can one shot even a whole party for 20 temporary drops that you have a 1% chance of getting and when you turn in you have a 10% chance of a reward. Of course I'm exaggerating but this is the kind of bs we're given. Is time not a factor considered here? Why has this game forsaken fun in endgame farming? There should be satisfaction in completing a goal but there rarely is any. \n\nWhen you have arrogant quest designers, a combat system that promotes or even encourages cheating added to the struggle of entertainment vs responsibility it's no wonder the most logical response is to cheat. Especially when doing so doesn't negatively affect you. So what's it gonna be? Are you going to do something or is cheating the new norm as many already seem to believe it is?\n",

It's been the elephant in the room for a long time, and now it's become very topical. Fair enough. But I have some issues with this that I wanted to air, and some clarifications about, personally, the nature of botters, and why collective unity is the best way forward.\n\nI see people actively victimising others now, and I won't deny that I've partaken. I've done the \"viciously beat the shit out of someone using reddit\" option, and it's been neither satisfying, nor helpful. Some legit players are acting like their entire arthritis grind has been vindicated by the latest 'bot purge'. Okay. It takes about 4-5 weeks using an automation program to max another account. Most people have accumulated tens of backups. It doesn't hurt, there's no grand chink in the armour, what you should be looking for is what helps heal AQW.\n\nI'm writing this to not so much the legittors, as the *anti-*botters. The people who invest their entire reason to be on the subreddit into insulting botters, on crowing and preaching absolute moral high ground because their entire reason to exist in the r/aqw space has been validated at last by a handful of grainy screenshots depicting a ban message and an endless yellow wheel.  I just ask you to think: what are you celebrating? Why do you infer that botters are bitter about the bans? Why do you infer that we're  mega upset, when in reality, it's an occupational hazard and some of us just feel like posting because it's something we have to share. It's pretty once in a while, no one is 'crying' or whatever. Now, a useful conversation piece? Could be, if certain people didn't jerk off their \"shoot the messenger\" egos. Here's a message for you. Don't lurk around waiting to be proven right. Just wait for an opportunity to make your view heard in a constructive way. When you're about to write something, ask yourself if this is going to really advance discussion, or if it's just another mud-slinging. The last thing we need to do right now is be distracted with eachother, when AE's recent appointments signal at least a temporary interest in this subject. We need everyone, but we all have to be fighting for a better AQW. Believe it or not, botters want that too. Don't carefully craft the cruellest comment possible. Instead, just say what you disagree with, why, and what your suggestion would be for fixing even the tiniest part of the game. The person you're talking to has had maybe 5 minutes to think about what they're about to write. Things can be gotten wrong. It shouldn't matter if what we all are building towards is a better AQW. Remember that your one-size-fits-all treatment of botters as scum might not come off so well if we're going to be future players together once AQW gets fixed. So, to end this with? It's not about vindication. It's about the changes AE needs to make.\n\nHere is a great opportunity to start talking as comrades. There needs to be a reminder - Botters are players too. Some may do it to recapture nostalgia. If you think cheating is adverse to the point, just remember it's a game which has let botting go unpunished for a long time. \"The point\" is relative to the perceiver. And it's none of your business to infer moral judgements on the perceiver, because enjoyment of the game is how they make it, and if botting figures, then no problem. It's something that AE need to reckon with, not something that you need to bully the living shit out of someone for, because that doesn't solve the problem, it just adds more dynamite. Right now, we don't need black and white thinking, because AQW hasn't given us any to work with. The last time we had black and white thinking, AQW lost a significant chunk of players. At the time, they not only shot themselves in the foot, they eroded a portion of community trust. And it's happened more since. One example, two words: Server Rewrite. And we all agree that their social media policy as a company is crappy and deliberately myopic. \n\nAll of this.... is not something to blame on botters. Stop projecting a stereotypical cheater concept on us when in reality, it's been the anti-botters who have been doing more to hurt the playerbase. In recent times, the derogatory language from anti-botters is at a hysterical high. You can scream all you like, but botting is what has kept AQW on life support. If you think botters never pay, find some evidence. I can't restate that enough. Find. Some. Goddamn. Evidence. Just playing legit doesn't instantly put you in the high ground, because the point of the debate is that all participants are equal and have worthwhile points. We're not asking for Cysero to be beheaded or anything so there are virtually nil fringe ideas bouncing around.\n\nAnother thing. You have this misguided idea that botters are supremacists, botters are narcissists, botters are creeps, botters are repulsive. Here's some news. We're not nearly as vocally oppositional as you lot are. I've been on the discords. The anti-botter ones are vastly more bitter. It's such a backward mindset to have because we badly need to try being united right now. At the same time, this mindset is by no means exclusive to anti-botters, for sure, but we have a lot less \"bad apples\".\n\nIn summary, I'd point out that resolving a situation like this takes time, and some accountability on AE's behalf. If we unify though, we can bolster and refine the currently weakish common point on this. Some highlights include quest incentive, particularly the sheer numbers of hours/monster kills. Everyone thinks that sucks, and if you think that botters are pansies for thinking that NSoD is not worth manually grinding, then you're exactly who I'm trying to beckon to this discussion. Please, reconsider your moral assertions, remember that AQW has gone through changes, and that actually, the NSoD questline is absurd. Hundreds of hours into a pixel game - you don't find that a little stupid? Given the historical lack of enforcement, people have felt free to bot it. But drawing moral assertions from that isn't okay. Let's try uniting as a playerbase, because AQW's reckoning is here, and we can all do something together.\n",
