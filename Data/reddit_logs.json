We value your safety and privacy above anything else. To download bots from this subreddit, go over to our portal website: [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/)\n\n**Firstly, you will need to download the Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7 application.** Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jozmg9/download_grimoire_38_pro_v177/) for more info on how to edit or use it. This is an exclusive service offered by our subreddit.\n\nOnce you have that, click Download Boots and search up the boot you want to run on the portal. Click on its name to download it. If you see a boot post on the subreddit, you may download it from there as well. Note that boots posted are approved by the moderators of this subreddit, and hence will guarantee their quality and safety. If you download a boot from a post in this subreddit, you will find virus scans as well. Make sure to upvote any boot that helps you!\n\nIf you're having trouble running a boot or would like to learn how to make edits in order to optimize it, use the [Grim 101 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9uke1qa0pzjAOTMUkasGR7Rqsz0fdOwdV0BaEzz0/edit) by /u/DragonTaryth. If you need assistance with a boot you downloaded, feel free to make a post on the subreddit, comment on the post you downloaded it from, or message us in one of our chat rooms. If you're posting on the subreddit, it helps a lot to take a screenshot of the part of your bot that isn't working. Just use a snipping tool.",

Moderators will go over your boot and make changes as necessary to optimize it as much as possible, and then upload it on the portal and send you a copy of the boot. When you have this copy, you may make a boot post on the subreddit, describing exactly what your boot does and instructions to run it and the like. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC4ceYgz8-ltXDKGw8hSPZIzywzwS3Mk4npYvCMiP7c/edit?usp=sharing) to find the boot post format and some other basic tips for boot makers to make your and our lives easier. If you have the permissions to, do make your comments section a live chat so it's easier to ask for any help needed.\n\nDo **NOT** post boot files on the subreddit. Doing so will be considered as a violation of the safety and privacy of our users and will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you post at least 5 good boots (before moderator edits), you can apply for a moderator position. You'll have limited permissions, but will gain more with contributions to our subreddit.",

You can also add the **Questions and Help** flair to allow people to immediately understand that you need help. If you can, make the comments section of your post a live chat so it's easier for us to diagnose and troubleshoot your problem.

            "image": null,
            "text": "**1. Why is my Boot not loading?** \n\nIf your boot isn't loading, this means you're using an outdated version of Grimoire. All new and recently made bots are made specifically for the latest versions of Grimoire, known as Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7. You can get the latest version of Grimoire from the Portal Site.\n\n**2. Boot keeps disconnecting?!**\n\nThis means your Boot Delay is very low. Most boots will have a \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command at the very top. You want to replace this with higher bot delay command. To do so, just head over to:\n\n    Misc -> Boot Delay -> (Change the number in the box to 10) -> Select the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command -> Hold Ctrl and Click \"Set Boot Delay\" -> Remove the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command.\n\nYou may now edit this command to a higher value such as 20 or 30 (by double clicking and replacing 10 with the desired number) if you're still disconnecting, but don't go too high as that would make the boot slow and inefficient. Some boots have a \"Set Boot Delay: 1\" command and those boots can be edited directly by double clicking.\n\n**3. Boot not working?**\n\nIf a boot isn't working, read the instructions on how to use the boot once again, if they are provided (they may be on the boot post on the subreddit or in the zip file in which you download your boots) before asking for help. Chances are you'll find your answer there. Furthermore, please take the time to read a guide on whatever item you're farming so you'll know exactly what the boot is supposed to be doing. If a boot stops without giving you the item you're farming, chances are it farmed all the required reagents and is waiting for you to turn in the quest yourself.",

You must have Grimoire 3.8+ PRO downloaded in order to run a boot from this subreddit.\n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD GRIMOIRE 3.8+ PRO:**\n\nGrimoire 3.8+ PRO is only supported by Windows. If you are a MacOS user, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPf1yVywKPk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n**To Download Grimoire 3.8+ PRO, you'll need either WinRAR or 7zip.** Once you have those, head over to our portal site, [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/), and click on **\"Download Grimoire\"**, which should automatically download it for you. Once you download it, you'll be able to run any boot you download from the same portal site. Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jghh66/download_boots/) for further information on how to download and run boots if you're new.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Grimoire 3.8+ PRO Exclusive Features:**\n\n1. **Selecting Multiple Commands:** Simply drag your pointer across various commands\n2. **Copying and Pasting Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+C to copy it and Ctrl+V to paste it below your selected line.\n3. **Duplicating Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+D to duplicate them.\n4. **Quickly Moving Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move them up or down respectively. You can hold Ctrl+Up/Down to move them several lines above or below also.\n5. **Adding Commands to a certain part of the boot:** Tired of adding a command and having it show up at the very bottom of the command list? Just go to the line above which you want to add the command, hold Ctrl, and add the command. For example, if you want to add a Kill \\* command above line 53 of your boot, select line 53, hold Ctrl, and add the Kill \\* command. It will show up in your desired position. (Actually a 3.8+ feature but very worth mentioning.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Advanced Commands (ignore if you're just a casual user):**\n\n**Index Commands:** Most lines in your command list in Grimoire 3.8+ PRO will have numbers next to them indicating which line it is, known as their index. You can add a command that makes the boot go to a specific index; or a command that goes a few Indexes up or down. You'll find Index commands in the Misc tab.\n\n**Integer Commands:** You can use a command to assign an integer value to a variable if you want the boot to remember information. Integer values can also be increased or decreased using commands. For example, if you want the boot to remember if the player is a member or not, you can make the boot go to a member only map like /nulgath, wait a few seconds, and set some variable (say, m) value as 1. Later on, if you want the boot to do something specific based on whether or not you're a member, you can add If Statement saying something along the lines of:\n\n    m == 1\n    Goto label: MEMBER\n\nInteger commands can be found in the Misc tab as well, and their If Statements can be found by going to the If Statement section and selecting Misc on the first line. You'll see Int is / Int is not / Int is greater than / Int is less than. There's a lot of stuff you can pull off with Indexes and Integers if used correctly.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut wait, that's not all!

When I log in and see that Artix is full I have to constantly wait to refresh or pray people on Yorumi are doing the grinds. So my proposal would be to combine some servers to create 3 \"mega-servers\". We could have an Artix server with a max amount of 5000 players (which is probably not going to be maxed out LOL), a Twilly server (for canned chat), and a Sir Ver (just because). Maybe a Espada server bc that decently populated too. What do you guys think?\n",

I have had the Dark Brotherhood guild name since the moment guilds released just never actively recruited. So here we are! I am looking for active players as I log on daily. The main goal is helping each other farm or catch up on story content. I am lv 83 with VHL, LR, LC, and Chaos Prime. I am well equipped to assist with pretty much everything. Right now I only have the base 15 slots open but if we get a large influx of people who want to join I will gladly buy more slots. I am on EST and only speak English. You are free to join regardless of your time zone or primary language just know that I might not be free to help or understand you if you are put of my time zone or don\u2019t primarily speak English. I play on Artix and Ser Ver mainly. I have a discord for the guild that I am setting up. Hope to hear from you!\n",

There was only 1 post on this \\~2 years ago and I would like to know your more updated opinion on this for 2021! :D\n\nIf anyone has had any similar thoughts please detail them below, in order, oh and please don't forget your reason on why! Thank you!\n\nLore-wise, My Top 5 would be:\n\n1. Dragon of Time - This class is basically us achieving our full potential.\n2. Eternal/Immortal Chronomancer - According to its description, your character transcends time & space and be in all dimensions an infinities at once.\n3. Eternal Inversionist - If I remember correctly, I believe this class can manipulate Space, Time, and Dimensions up to the 4th dimension.\n4. Infinity Titan - Doesn't this class basically let us manipulate Time, Space, **Reality**, Souls, Minds, and Something similar to Power?\n5. Chaos Champion Prime - You're basically Drakath at his most powerful.\n",

Me and my girlfriend are trying to get back into the game, what should we know? What is there to even do? I see a lot of posts about \"botting\", what is that? and is that the norm? \n\nAlso, can anyone take a look at my character page and let me know if my classes are fine for today? I feel like mine are outdated and replaced by better ones. For example, I saw a post earlier that said Necro isn't a good solo class anymore, compared to some of the newer classes. That came as a shock to me, since I remember thinking it was OP lol. \n\nFinally, it is one of my goals to get Seppy's armor and helm, as he was always my favorite character. Is the grind for it tremendously long?\n",

I really like the sword and as a Lv40 f2p player with the dark lord as the farming class, I\u2019d like to get an estimated time of how long it will time i barely have spare time. Also any tips on where to farm the quest items easily?\n",

She only appeared at the beginning of the tutorial called \"Newbie\" and the actual event,I was very confused by the cutscenes after the infernal event.\n\nWhy did Robina allow her sister to get involved with the investigation with our protagonist and the story of the soldiers sent by the queen of monsters? Since when is Tara here in the shadowfall fortress reunited with allies? Why didn't Brentan talk to this girl at all? Robina and Brentan became babysitters? When Tara was kidnapped, I was really pissed because Robina is very irresponsible for not watching you and was frustrated for not protecting you. \n\nDetail: she is the only surviving sister after losing her father, your highness.\n",

            "text": "Now, not to hate on anyone writing the \"newest\" Queen of Monsters saga, but I really don't think we need to do this again. It's been a few years and I'll explain why this isn't necessary at this time and maybe what they could be doing with this whole month. Even though it won't change anything, this announcement which would've excited me 2 years ago now just increases the suffering I feel by sticking with this game. Here we go, with a summary down below. **Spoilers I guess, but who cares at this point?**  \n\n\n  \nThe **Queen of Monsters** was set up to be the big bad antagonist after we dispatched Drakath at the Chaos Finale. She was an ancient being who was rooted in Lore before the reset and persisted as the Mother of Chaos, granting Drakath control over chaos, which led to that entire plotline. The key word was, well, was. In 2019, in favour of a shadowidiot who doesn't know how to read the wiki, they decided to \"\"\"temporarily\"\"\" dispatch the Queen of Monsters by showing her severed head to us and having shadowidiot tell us that we're responsible, even though we've never met her face to face once. In 4 years. Not once. Amazing. This shocked me because I really didn't think they could mess up a character this badly, and if they could, they would at least give a reason as to why they decided to kill her through Design Notes or some other means of storytelling but no. Why would I even expect anything?   \n\n\nWe got **shadowidiot** for coming up on 2 years now, and one of AQW's issues is its seasonal season basically throwing out the main story for nearly half of the year, not allowing it to progress because of the bunched holidays and AC packages they have to sell. This led to the Summer of 2019 focusing about gathering guys to fight shadowidiot, then proceeding to not see those guys for a while due to the break, and here we are, going up on the summer of 2021 and we haven't had use for 2 of those allies since. Mainly because they decided that fighting random generals and having shadowidiot not have a simple goal would be a good idea for an antagonist who embodies edge. Starts with leylines, dabbles in ancient relics and Macguffins, maybe a little bit of amulet here, some amulet there, amulet everywhere. It's messy. But at least it's linear. They JUST RECENTLY decided that it would be nice to let people track the story so they put it in the story tab after who knows how long, and it's got a ton of shadowidiot related adventures that tend to only have cameos of him in the releases themselves. Seem similar?  \n\n\nThe **issue** with attempting to revive the queen saga is that, whether you like it or not, you already killed it. More than once. The setup post chaos finale was scrapped, so /summon doesn't matter anymore. When people complained about the carbon copy generals of the queen stuff, you changed it to something else, something ACTUALLY GOOD, exploring the origins of the monsters she had created and why she's called what she is. But then, out of nowhere, for a rushed finale that can barely be considered an end to her reign as a villain, you decided to shove her out of the spotlight for a shadow who can't even stand in it. \n\nIt's not like the trope of a villain being temporarily dispatched, only to be revealed to be alive later isn't useful, heck it's used in a lot of places and is effective occasionally. But the issue is that when you make it seem as if she's dead, give no mention to her besides this weird excuse regarding her death, and don't mention her or any of the things she's done that have drastically changed lore, her just showing up in the middle of ANOTHER antagonist's spotlight, one that has barely expanded since showing up on the scene 2 years ago unexpectedly almost makes it seem as if she wasn't a complete character and didn't have a proper end. Huh. Funny how that works.   \n\n\nMy **point** is this, and these tend to not have a point. Instead of, I don't know, working with old material that was clearly discarded years ago and doesn't actually develop the world you're working in cause haha worldbuilding, why not, I know, focus on the antagonist who we know basically nothing about and attempt to flesh out the new characters you tried to introduce in 6 different releases? I get that the Queen is supposed to be some pivotal part of Lore, but the failure and lack of overall direction in her saga heavily hinders her ability to be, well, important to anyone that isn't me.   \n\n\nIt's funny how I wouldn't be saying this if this release came, I don't know, **AFTER** the Book of Monsters when you tried to do this the first time and succeeded. The Rift is an AMAZING zone that is located IN a previously established area that has existed since the start of the game. It has some new, some old characters and even some Easter eggs thrown in, while managing to keep the tone desperate and depressing. Instead of slotting it in now, after the not great not really a finale finale of her saga, it would have been much more beneficial if the Book of Monsters continued. Heck, the **BOOK OF MONSTERS** is in your release!   \n\n\n**But I digress. A simple summary of what I've just said is:**\n\n\\-**The Queen was fine as an antagonist after the reboot and was set up well from the beginning of the game**  \n\\-**The inability to close out the saga or actually have a plan for it heavily hindered it up until its finale, or whatever that was supposed to be**  \n\\-**Malgor is dumb, stupid and dumb, and also suffers from a lack of character, because they forgot to give him that too**  \n\\-**Even if I don't like shadowidiot, you should stick to him because you started this mess, and someone has to clean this up before it gets out of hand**  \n\n\n**I guess Malgor and the Queen share something in common, being brainless. Basically, all this jumping around doesn't get you somewhere if it's not at the right time. After all, that's one of the reasons this game dropped so hard after Chaos Finale, isn't it?**\n",

            "image": null,
            "text": "Most of you will know how it works, **specific race damage boost** or **multiple races damage boost** ***stack*** with **damage boost to all monsters**, so NSoD, Awescended Omni Blades, BBoA or such **will stack** with other sources like SDKA, Polly Roger (since is **damage to all tagged monsters**, not damage to all monsters) or Head of the Legion Beast (40% more damage to Humans/Undeads and 30% more damage to Dragons).\n\nI'm ok with this bit, it's fine if they don't stack, however, something that many people may not realize is that **equipping** an item with **lower boosts** ***after*** will overwrite the higher ones, so equipping NSoD first and equipping AFDL after, **will decrease your damage** vs all monsters from 51% to 35%, since the latest one equipped is the one used. This also affects if you are using specific damage boosts, for example, Blinding Light of Destiny has a 75% extra damage vs Undeads, so **equipping** something with **a lower boost** to that race after (even if it grants damage boosts against multiple races, like what happens with Polly Roger), it **will decrease your damage boost**.\n\nAE already stated multiple times that this is **not a bug**, however, it's still incredibly annoying, since it forces you to **re-equip your whole set**, which paired with enhancements makes the game way less interactive, and goes against the idea of being able to change your outfit at any given time. That's why I really think they should change it **so the highest damage boost is always applied**, even if they still doesn't stack, or at least a \"Boost checker\" that makes you able to check which boosts are active at any time.\n\nI'd love to see other's opinion about this topic, and hopefully AE changes something to make it less awkward than what it is now.\n",

It's happened twice, like one 2 separate days. This affected all enemies.\n\nWhat is causing this? Bug? Server XP rate increase?\n\nI'm confused as I've just gotten back in to AQW after not really playing at all since 2014. But I personally like having this high xp rate as the game got super grindy after they made 65 the level cap. I remember always hitting it before it was raised until level 55/65 I got to 49 and then stopped\n",

I need suggestions on house items parading around the theme of  being fantastical. The star wars set works, as well as the sneeviltron and such. I'm using a pirate house with 9 rooms to spare I want to avoid a lot of the nation and legion house guards. I don't need anymore edge in my life (VHL and LR is enough).

            "text": "Hi, Void Highlord meme guy here again. Don't worry, tl;dr at bottom ;).\n\nI made a little survey that was supposed to shed some light on how many people are botting or have botted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/ndj3nv/which\\_of\\_these\\_best\\_represent\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/ndj3nv/which_of_these_best_represent_you/) .\n\nIf you assume that this poll of about 400 people represents the whole community (which is not that bold of an assumption), then 62.4 % of all players have botted before and 26 % are botting currently. I got very mixed vibes from the comments. There are people strongly against botting, and people who think botting is essential to enjoy the game properly.\n\nA game's sole purpose is to bring joy. If a loyal player of a game craves some external program or bot to bring the appropriate amount of joy for the game to be playable, something is not right. \n\nMany non-botters brought forth the argument that AQW is about the satisfaction of working for an item. That's is undoubtedly true. AQW has always been about getting rewarded for your hard work. I remember the day I FINALLY got rank 10 chaos with my Mage class after days of farming on my old laptop. I will never forget that feeling, because it encapsulates this game so well.\n\nHowever, the farmable items have grown more difficult and ridiculous to obtain with time. Their power has also considerably spiked. A lot of people in the comments also mentioned that the Void Highlord and Legion Revenant grinds are NOT mandatory. But, what's the point of playing AQW and not getting the most EPIC items? Who doesn't want Void Highlord or another cool OP class?\n\n\"Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody wants to lift heavy ass weights\" - Ronnie Coleman. This is where the problem starts. Every wants the items. but nobody wants to \"lift heavy ass weights\" because the weight lifting is just too boring and not worth it.\n\nDo you remember the Leprechaun event classes? What a joy it was to farm for them! You actually were having fun whilst playing AQW. They had all these cool minigames and you needed to stay focused and do your best if you wanted the maximum amount of rewards. Now, a lot of the farming seems dull and very repetitive, almost as if it was *made* for a machine. I mean, who wants to click skeletons until you have 40 thousand bone dust, so you can merge them into Tainted Gems, just for you to realize that you're not even 20 % done with the farming process? Easier to let a bot do the monotone work and have fun with events and other content.\n\nI get that AQW is not their main focus right now, but it should be! AQW is the game that made them famous and it is the most iconic of them all.\n\nWhat do you think? Is change necessary?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Many people are botting because of different reasons. AQW is about the satisfaction of getting an item, but the items are harder and harder to get. So people bot instead of doing repetitive tasks because they're boring. Is change necessary?\n",

Killing a monster 10,000 times? Please no.\n\nIt honestly bothered me how Legion Revenant wasn't like this, when ArchPaladin came out before it, and seeing how great the grind was it frustrates me why the LR grind was so different. 1 was hands-on,you need to actually participate in the game to play, and you need other players to kill a boss. The other 1 requires you to get a decent class and kill mosnters again and again repetitively.\n\nThe principle is the same(killing monsters repetitively) but because you let the players become engaged at the game, it suddenly becomes more fun.\n",

            "image": null,
            "text": "One of the most common questions both new and returning players would usually ask is how they can maximize the value of the 2,000 AC's they have. In this post, I will share to you on the best way to use them, so none of them will go to waste. \n\nBTW, be sure to check on your Account Page so you can get yourself a Bonus Package (if you bought an AC/Membership Package). You have a wide variety of options, all of which contain gear such as armors and weapons, sometimes even houses. It's all up to you on which would you choose. In my opinion, however, the package with the most value is Infinity Titan. It includes weapons, armors, helms, capes, pets, a house and a class variant. The class variant it has is a reskin of Stonecrusher, which is arguably the best support class in the game. It's effects also stack with a Stonecrusher if one is present in a room you're in. \n\nBefore spending your AC's you should do the following first: \n\n\u2022 Get Rank 10 in Doomwood and Embersea rep. You can search for guides on YouTube on how to increase your rep fast.\n\u2022 Pre-farm 200 Combat Trophies. Do this in a private room so you can do it faster.\n\u2022 Complete the following quest lines:\n       \u2022 Black Knight in /greenguardweat\n       \u2022 Snowbeard & Donna Charmer's quests in /tavern and /llama\n       \u2022 Do all quests in /willowcreek until you are able to see a Dwakel Soldier. \n\nAfter you've done all that, follow this in order: \n\n1. Buy Pyromancer from the Class Shop in the Game Menu for 2,000 AC's. Once you have at least 1 class point for the class, go to /fireforge and look for an NPC named High Adept Caustus and open the AC Pyromancer Sigil shop. Since you have Rank 10 rep for Doomwood and Embersea you will be able to get a Darkness Sigil and Flame Sigil. You can merge that for the Blaze Binder class, one of the best farming classes in the game. After getting the class, sell your Pyromancer to get 1,800 AC's back. Make sure to do this in less than 24 hours so you can maximize the sellback value of the class. \n\nEven though you can do this, I would rather recommend you to just do the dailies to merge for Pyromancer. \n\n2. Go to /underworld and look for Dage the Evil. Open his armor shop and buy Undead Warrior for 1,200 AC's. Once you do, complete Dage's quests from \"Undead Champion Initiation\" until \"Fail to the King.\" After that, sell back Undead Warrior for 1,080 AC's. Again, make sure to do this in less than 24 hours so you can maximize the sellback value of the armor. \n\nOnce you complete this you will be a member of the Legion. With this you will have more access to classes like Legion DoomKnight, Yami no Ronin, and Legion Revenant, and more awesome gear, especially in March during Dage's birthday. \n\n3. Get yourself a LightMage class that can be upgraded into Lightcaster, one of the best solo and support classes in the game, once you reach level 80. To do this go to /celestialrealm, talk to Aranx and buy an Evolved Lightcaster armor for 1,000 AC's then buy the LightMage class. It is a pretty good class as well if you don't have Lightcaster yet.\n\nNotes:\n\u2022 Make sure to do the first and second part in less than 24 hours. If you follow this guide properly, you could get up to 880 AC's, depending on if you do the AC method of Blaze Binder.\n\u2022 I do not recommend you to buy classes for 2,000 AC's because all of them are farmable and are not worth the value. Seasonal or rare classes, however, are okay if you choose the right one. I recommend getting Timeless/Immortal Dark Caster class during March or Abyssal Angel's Shadow during November.\n\u2022 I don't recommend spending AC's on Fortune Tickets and/or Treasure Chest keys because they are based on RNG. If you want to do it, go for it I guess.\n\nHere are other suggestions on AC items that I believe are worth the money:\n\u2022 Nulgath Birthday Gift (seasonal) is arguably the best Nulgath regeant farming pet especially if you plan on farming for Void Highlord and Enchanted Nulgath Nation House.\n\u2022 If you have cash to burn and have 6,000 AC's you can get calendar classes in /curio as they are the best soloing classes in the game. I recommend\u00a0 Shadowstalker of Time because it is well-rounded.\n\u2022 Bank pets cost 2,000 AC's and are made for convenience. If you have one you can just click on it and access your bank. Then again, you could just get a Bonus Package that has bank capes.\n\u2022 You can also get seasonal and event rares if you're into that stuff. \n\nThat's pretty much it. You can spend your AC's however you want. These are just recommendations on how you can make the most out of it. If you have other ideas or corrections, feel free to share them in the replies. Have fun and Battle On!\n",

            "text": "  \n**Spoilers for this week's release and whatever Queen related stuff you didn't know. But once again, who cares....**\n\n  \nAfter playing the most recent release in the \"Queen of Monsters\" saga, I thought it was going to be over. I thought I could move on from this character and acknowledge that although the saga had potential, it failed in execution through a series of changes and unfortunate timing. But I can't even do that.  \n\n\nI'll just state the problems since I can see those more clearly than the good parts of the release.  \n\n\n**Anka. Yes, Anka.** It's really hard to care. Like it actually takes a fair amount of effort to care. She's like, supposed to be more than the quest giver, but she doesn't really develop at all? I can barely call her a character, and I'm not sure if the intention was for her to be one, because I don't feel anything when she's dead. Heck, good riddance. She showed up for this saga, was the driving force for this saga, and died in this saga. Laguna, the MERDRACONIAN FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO, did this better, because the whole accept power, corrupted by power you can't control thing, although a recycled formula and basically the basis of shadowflame and all that, was newer in the chaos style. This feels like the exact same sort of thing, but I care less about the random human who wanted knowledge than the random merdraconian with a ship. Funny. I would go on about her being the antagonist but honestly? The antagonist of this story was me, trying to find a reason to play it.  \n\n\n**The Twins**. Do I even have to say much about this? While they weren't fully fleshed out characters before, they got a little better with duality plane (and a little worse in some ways) and really haven't had the chance to be important besides Xing's scuffle in the mirror realm. That sorta didn't really do anything. But I have the pleasure of saying that this release, they actually manage to make worse. The cutscenes with Drakath are filler, and instead of going towards all this info that Anka is saying, it goes to the Twins playing around with Drakath on their new cellphone. Those could have just been skipped if you just added Drakath going down the tunnel at the end of last release. Worst of all, they take away screen time from us, the protagonist, and Anka, the soon to be antagonist. **BUT THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING.** They don't help us fight, they don't report correctly to Drakath and they don't serve a purpose to the actual narrative. Comic relief can exist but it's a lot easier if you have it tied into characters who actually, I dunno, do something other than be funny-not-funny. Sorry, but they're just a shell of their former, chaos saga selves. It's one of the reasons why I question even bringing them back in the first place.  \n\n\n**The info**. The singular thing I thought this release was going to do was actually shed some light on the Queen and it did. It told us about her origins and how she came to be, and although it seems a little too out of the blue that she just happened to live without a heart for a few months and create a portal to another realm, a new plane of existence, I can overlook it because it's unique in its nature. A little convenient yes, but I've seen crazier and more spontaneous. But like Drakath said all this time, if she's dead why bother. And that was a question that I constantly have to think about. The hero doesn't justify their decision here, or stress why it's so important we learn about it. It just happens and we get roped into this mess. And what do you know, at the end of the release we have this magical plot device that can tell us what we need to know, and what do they do?  \n\n\nNot use a flashback cutscene? Wait what? Hold on. You're telling me, we used the somehow all powerful knowing device to confirm what Malgor told us about 2 years ago, but we still don't know what actually happened? And there's TIME SHENANIGANS INVOLVED? Why did we even bother, we have actually only learned info that while nice to know, doesn't help us in the future because the queen is dead. Or she should be. Who knows at this point. Hurts my brain to think about.  \n\n\n**The End.....?**  \n\n\nIt's funny how I played this and thought that I actually might have preferred a month of Malgor updates over this. Mainly because even though they will focus on him later in June, this just didn't feel like a story I wanted to play. Not because the hero was shoehorned into it due to plot. Not even cause the characters were definitely lacking. Mainly just because the majority of the release just felt like fetching simulator with Anka to get into this tunnel that was never mentioned and is just here now in a location that Drakath just so happened to build his castle on and doesn't have any prior significance to chaos like Thunderforge did and required a book that Drakath just so happened to have stumbled upon and secured that happens to know the way to this tunnel that Anka somehow just knows about.  \n\n\n  \n**The End (Summary)**  \n\n\nThe release does things amazingly. We're back to auto completes being standard, amazing map and monster designs and music quality is sounding okay in most of the maps. Most. But the actual story and content of the release. Can't believe I'm saying this but you might enjoy it more if you just skipped the cutscenes.   \n\n\nIn conclusion, if the Queen of Monsters isn't dead after this release, I'll make a post about everything that's wrong with the entire saga from start to finish. Including whatever bits were thrown in between. And I don't think I'll enjoy making it. \n\nIf it's too long to read, don't bother. It's just my opinion and who knows, maybe you liked the saga. But  there's problems and I'm not hesitant to point them out.\n",

I got 2 items from the awesomeness stuff, legion revenant and Necro (I know many of you are gonna be like why buy two farmable items wtf?!)\n\nSimply put, the grind for them is just tedious, I've played games like BDO/Runescape, grind doesn't bother me. The grind is this game makes it so anything like revenant you're gonna be spending hours in one day just getting one thing.\n\nFor example to put it into context, you need 20 spellscrolls for legion fealty for. You have to do the first quest 20 times for one item.\n\nNow, why do I say it's not worth it? Simply put, regret. It's really not worth it, you may want the items like I did, but in the end take my advice, don't do it.\n\nHope this persuades someone else from making this mistake :\\]\n",

Might actually be B tier at soloing. Your solo DPS seems to be very reliant on whether or not your last skill crits. I didn't really test out farming too much, but it seems to have pretty good sustain and damage (maybe A tier farmer, on par with Dark Lord).\n\n    As much as I don't like classes that play around with your health, it's kind of a fun mechanic how you have to play around with Psion Drain and Cerebral Siphon to balance your HP and mana (skills are not spammable). Overall decent class, just feels kinda weird to use.\n",
