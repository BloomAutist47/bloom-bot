            "image": null,
            "text": "It's as simple as the title says. AQW has trash punishment for cheating and something needs to change. A permanent loss of account for mentioning cheating vs a 3 day for actually doing it? I know there are some AE staff who check this place so what the heck is up with this? You mean to tell me I could mention the word bot in game and be met with a worse punishment than the actual action? If that isn't pathetic, I don't know what is. You punish the action not the word. Who even thought this was okay? If actual cheating gets you a temporary time out, maybe that's why nearly everyone does it? No wonder people treat the game as a joke. \n\nI'll offer a possible change. AQW is a game where items you have play a big role in how good your account is so get rid of the whole temporary account timeout and remove illegitimately gained gear and also restrict the account from accessing the actual quests to farm for said gear for a yet to be determined period. Simply put, if you bot, you can't farm for a while. \n\nIn addition to this, make grinds less annoying. The DoT class farming was done right. You had to work with others to finish and near everyone had a decent time with it. If all endgame grinds were like this why would anyone bot? You'd be doing everyone a favor. Instead we are almost always given these endgame grinds which are the crazed antics of a lunatic shoved at our faces. Kill this 1 million hp boss that can one shot even a whole party for 20 temporary drops that you have a 1% chance of getting and when you turn in you have a 10% chance of a reward. Of course I'm exaggerating but this is the kind of bs we're given. Is time not a factor considered here? Why has this game forsaken fun in endgame farming? There should be satisfaction in completing a goal but there rarely is any. \n\nWhen you have arrogant quest designers, a combat system that promotes or even encourages cheating added to the struggle of entertainment vs responsibility it's no wonder the most logical response is to cheat. Especially when doing so doesn't negatively affect you. So what's it gonna be? Are you going to do something or is cheating the new norm as many already seem to believe it is?\n",
