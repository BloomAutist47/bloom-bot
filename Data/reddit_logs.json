We value your safety and privacy above anything else. To download bots from this subreddit, go over to our portal website: [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/)\n\n**Firstly, you will need to download the Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7 application.** Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jozmg9/download_grimoire_38_pro_v177/) for more info on how to edit or use it. This is an exclusive service offered by our subreddit.\n\nOnce you have that, click Download Boots and search up the boot you want to run on the portal. Click on its name to download it. If you see a boot post on the subreddit, you may download it from there as well. Note that boots posted are approved by the moderators of this subreddit, and hence will guarantee their quality and safety. If you download a boot from a post in this subreddit, you will find virus scans as well. Make sure to upvote any boot that helps you!\n\nIf you're having trouble running a boot or would like to learn how to make edits in order to optimize it, use the [Grim 101 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9uke1qa0pzjAOTMUkasGR7Rqsz0fdOwdV0BaEzz0/edit) by /u/DragonTaryth. If you need assistance with a boot you downloaded, feel free to make a post on the subreddit, comment on the post you downloaded it from, or message us in one of our chat rooms. If you're posting on the subreddit, it helps a lot to take a screenshot of the part of your bot that isn't working. Just use a snipping tool.",

Moderators will go over your boot and make changes as necessary to optimize it as much as possible, and then upload it on the portal and send you a copy of the boot. When you have this copy, you may make a boot post on the subreddit, describing exactly what your boot does and instructions to run it and the like. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC4ceYgz8-ltXDKGw8hSPZIzywzwS3Mk4npYvCMiP7c/edit?usp=sharing) to find the boot post format and some other basic tips for boot makers to make your and our lives easier. If you have the permissions to, do make your comments section a live chat so it's easier to ask for any help needed.\n\nDo **NOT** post boot files on the subreddit. Doing so will be considered as a violation of the safety and privacy of our users and will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you post at least 5 good boots (before moderator edits), you can apply for a moderator position. You'll have limited permissions, but will gain more with contributions to our subreddit.",

You can also add the **Questions and Help** flair to allow people to immediately understand that you need help. If you can, make the comments section of your post a live chat so it's easier for us to diagnose and troubleshoot your problem.

            "image": null,
            "text": "**1. Why is my Boot not loading?** \n\nIf your boot isn't loading, this means you're using an outdated version of Grimoire. All new and recently made bots are made specifically for the latest versions of Grimoire, known as Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7. You can get the latest version of Grimoire from the Portal Site.\n\n**2. Boot keeps disconnecting?!**\n\nThis means your Boot Delay is very low. Most boots will have a \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command at the very top. You want to replace this with higher bot delay command. To do so, just head over to:\n\n    Misc -> Boot Delay -> (Change the number in the box to 10) -> Select the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command -> Hold Ctrl and Click \"Set Boot Delay\" -> Remove the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command.\n\nYou may now edit this command to a higher value such as 20 or 30 (by double clicking and replacing 10 with the desired number) if you're still disconnecting, but don't go too high as that would make the boot slow and inefficient. Some boots have a \"Set Boot Delay: 1\" command and those boots can be edited directly by double clicking.\n\n**3. Boot not working?**\n\nIf a boot isn't working, read the instructions on how to use the boot once again, if they are provided (they may be on the boot post on the subreddit or in the zip file in which you download your boots) before asking for help. Chances are you'll find your answer there. Furthermore, please take the time to read a guide on whatever item you're farming so you'll know exactly what the boot is supposed to be doing. If a boot stops without giving you the item you're farming, chances are it farmed all the required reagents and is waiting for you to turn in the quest yourself.",

You must have Grimoire 3.8+ PRO downloaded in order to run a boot from this subreddit.\n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD GRIMOIRE 3.8+ PRO:**\n\nGrimoire 3.8+ PRO is only supported by Windows. If you are a MacOS user, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPf1yVywKPk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n**To Download Grimoire 3.8+ PRO, you'll need either WinRAR or 7zip.** Once you have those, head over to our portal site, [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/), and click on **\"Download Grimoire\"**, which should automatically download it for you. Once you download it, you'll be able to run any boot you download from the same portal site. Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jghh66/download_boots/) for further information on how to download and run boots if you're new.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Grimoire 3.8+ PRO Exclusive Features:**\n\n1. **Selecting Multiple Commands:** Simply drag your pointer across various commands\n2. **Copying and Pasting Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+C to copy it and Ctrl+V to paste it below your selected line.\n3. **Duplicating Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+D to duplicate them.\n4. **Quickly Moving Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move them up or down respectively. You can hold Ctrl+Up/Down to move them several lines above or below also.\n5. **Adding Commands to a certain part of the boot:** Tired of adding a command and having it show up at the very bottom of the command list? Just go to the line above which you want to add the command, hold Ctrl, and add the command. For example, if you want to add a Kill \\* command above line 53 of your boot, select line 53, hold Ctrl, and add the Kill \\* command. It will show up in your desired position. (Actually a 3.8+ feature but very worth mentioning.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Advanced Commands (ignore if you're just a casual user):**\n\n**Index Commands:** Most lines in your command list in Grimoire 3.8+ PRO will have numbers next to them indicating which line it is, known as their index. You can add a command that makes the boot go to a specific index; or a command that goes a few Indexes up or down. You'll find Index commands in the Misc tab.\n\n**Integer Commands:** You can use a command to assign an integer value to a variable if you want the boot to remember information. Integer values can also be increased or decreased using commands. For example, if you want the boot to remember if the player is a member or not, you can make the boot go to a member only map like /nulgath, wait a few seconds, and set some variable (say, m) value as 1. Later on, if you want the boot to do something specific based on whether or not you're a member, you can add If Statement saying something along the lines of:\n\n    m == 1\n    Goto label: MEMBER\n\nInteger commands can be found in the Misc tab as well, and their If Statements can be found by going to the If Statement section and selecting Misc on the first line. You'll see Int is / Int is not / Int is greater than / Int is less than. There's a lot of stuff you can pull off with Indexes and Integers if used correctly.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut wait, that's not all!

I've noticed one difference between the two, and it's that Cetera, old as it is, is one compact .exe file, rather than one entire folder with the client and other stuff like Grimoire/Grimlite (as I said, I tried running them so I kinda remember that), and with that being said, maybe Cetera works for me because it's one file with all the content to be run, and maybe Grimoire/Grimlite won't work because the client file needs all the other files to be present in order to run but somehow Mac can't do that, starting with the fact that's an .exe file we're talking about and that a media player can only run one file at a time in one session and won't access multiple ones like you'd expect. Basically my suggestion here is **tryna turn the entire Grimoire/Grimlite folder into one .exe file with everything inside**, if that's possible though. And I think that's the easier one of the two because my next suggestion is\n\n2. **Directly trying to make Grimoire/Grimlite compatible with Mac, maybe as a .dmg or something**. It would be really nice but I really don't know how this would work, since to my understanding Apple in general has always been really like \"official\", and maybe there'd be licence stuff going on and such, however if this turned out ok it'd be the best out of the two.\n\nI'm talking on behalf of all Mac users who been tryna bot but can't due to all bots being mostly .exes, yeah we exist, sorry.\n",

Recently I've been trying for the Armor of Awe for the new questline and while grinding for it I've wondering why in fact there are so many server when most of them barely have over 100 players. When I log in and see that Artix is full I have to constantly wait to refresh or pray people on Yorumi are doing the grinds. So my proposal would be to combine some servers to create 3 \"mega-servers\". We could have an Artix server with a max amount of 5000 players (which is probably not going to be maxed out LOL), a Twilly server (for canned chat), and a Sir Ver (just because). Maybe a Espada server bc that decently populated too. What do you guys think?\n",

The main goal is helping each other farm or catch up on story content. I am lv 83 with VHL, LR, LC, and Chaos Prime. I am well equipped to assist with pretty much everything. Right now I only have the base 15 slots open but if we get a large influx of people who want to join I will gladly buy more slots. I am on EST and only speak English. You are free to join regardless of your time zone or primary language just know that I might not be free to help or understand you if you are put of my time zone or don\u2019t primarily speak English. I play on Artix and Ser Ver mainly. I have a discord for the guild that I am setting up. Hope to hear from you!\n",

There was only 1 post on this \\~2 years ago and I would like to know your more updated opinion on this for 2021! :D\n\nIf anyone has had any similar thoughts please detail them below, in order, oh and please don't forget your reason on why! Thank you!\n\nLore-wise, My Top 5 would be:\n\n1. Dragon of Time - This class is basically us achieving our full potential.\n2. Eternal/Immortal Chronomancer - According to its description, your character transcends time & space and be in all dimensions an infinities at once.\n3. Eternal Inversionist - If I remember correctly, I believe this class can manipulate Space, Time, and Dimensions up to the 4th dimension.\n4. Infinity Titan - Doesn't this class basically let us manipulate Time, Space, **Reality**, Souls, Minds, and Something similar to Power?\n5. Chaos Champion Prime - You're basically Drakath at his most powerful.\n",

[character page](https://account.aq.com/CharPage?id=123won)\n\nI've played a lil here and there to get some new classes throughout the years, but haven't played seriously for a while. Me and my girlfriend are trying to get back into the game, what should we know? What is there to even do? I see a lot of posts about \"botting\", what is that? and is that the norm? \n\nAlso, can anyone take a look at my character page and let me know if my classes are fine for today? I feel like mine are outdated and replaced by better ones. For example, I saw a post earlier that said Necro isn't a good solo class anymore, compared to some of the newer classes. That came as a shock to me, since I remember thinking it was OP lol. \n\nFinally, it is one of my goals to get Seppy's armor and helm, as he was always my favorite character. Is the grind for it tremendously long?\n",

I also have level 10 LightMage in my bank, but I'm only character level 77 so I cant start the LightCaster chain quite yet.  \n\n\nI also plan on doing Arcangrove (R1), Embersea (R5), and Swordhaven (R7) next.  \n\n\nWhat other reputations are worth doing while the boost is active?\n",

            "image": null,
            "text": "Now, not to hate on anyone writing the \"newest\" Queen of Monsters saga, but I really don't think we need to do this again. It's been a few years and I'll explain why this isn't necessary at this time and maybe what they could be doing with this whole month. Even though it won't change anything, this announcement which would've excited me 2 years ago now just increases the suffering I feel by sticking with this game. Here we go, with a summary down below. **Spoilers I guess, but who cares at this point?**  \n\n\n  \nThe **Queen of Monsters** was set up to be the big bad antagonist after we dispatched Drakath at the Chaos Finale. She was an ancient being who was rooted in Lore before the reset and persisted as the Mother of Chaos, granting Drakath control over chaos, which led to that entire plotline. The key word was, well, was. In 2019, in favour of a shadowidiot who doesn't know how to read the wiki, they decided to \"\"\"temporarily\"\"\" dispatch the Queen of Monsters by showing her severed head to us and having shadowidiot tell us that we're responsible, even though we've never met her face to face once. In 4 years. Not once. Amazing. This shocked me because I really didn't think they could mess up a character this badly, and if they could, they would at least give a reason as to why they decided to kill her through Design Notes or some other means of storytelling but no. Why would I even expect anything?   \n\n\nWe got **shadowidiot** for coming up on 2 years now, and one of AQW's issues is its seasonal season basically throwing out the main story for nearly half of the year, not allowing it to progress because of the bunched holidays and AC packages they have to sell. This led to the Summer of 2019 focusing about gathering guys to fight shadowidiot, then proceeding to not see those guys for a while due to the break, and here we are, going up on the summer of 2021 and we haven't had use for 2 of those allies since. Mainly because they decided that fighting random generals and having shadowidiot not have a simple goal would be a good idea for an antagonist who embodies edge. Starts with leylines, dabbles in ancient relics and Macguffins, maybe a little bit of amulet here, some amulet there, amulet everywhere. It's messy. But at least it's linear. They JUST RECENTLY decided that it would be nice to let people track the story so they put it in the story tab after who knows how long, and it's got a ton of shadowidiot related adventures that tend to only have cameos of him in the releases themselves. Seem similar?  \n\n\nThe **issue** with attempting to revive the queen saga is that, whether you like it or not, you already killed it. More than once. The setup post chaos finale was scrapped, so /summon doesn't matter anymore. When people complained about the carbon copy generals of the queen stuff, you changed it to something else, something ACTUALLY GOOD, exploring the origins of the monsters she had created and why she's called what she is. But then, out of nowhere, for a rushed finale that can barely be considered an end to her reign as a villain, you decided to shove her out of the spotlight for a shadow who can't even stand in it. \n\nIt's not like the trope of a villain being temporarily dispatched, only to be revealed to be alive later isn't useful, heck it's used in a lot of places and is effective occasionally. But the issue is that when you make it seem as if she's dead, give no mention to her besides this weird excuse regarding her death, and don't mention her or any of the things she's done that have drastically changed lore, her just showing up in the middle of ANOTHER antagonist's spotlight, one that has barely expanded since showing up on the scene 2 years ago unexpectedly almost makes it seem as if she wasn't a complete character and didn't have a proper end. Huh. Funny how that works.   \n\n\nMy **point** is this, and these tend to not have a point. Instead of, I don't know, working with old material that was clearly discarded years ago and doesn't actually develop the world you're working in cause haha worldbuilding, why not, I know, focus on the antagonist who we know basically nothing about and attempt to flesh out the new characters you tried to introduce in 6 different releases? I get that the Queen is supposed to be some pivotal part of Lore, but the failure and lack of overall direction in her saga heavily hinders her ability to be, well, important to anyone that isn't me.   \n\n\nIt's funny how I wouldn't be saying this if this release came, I don't know, **AFTER** the Book of Monsters when you tried to do this the first time and succeeded. The Rift is an AMAZING zone that is located IN a previously established area that has existed since the start of the game. It has some new, some old characters and even some Easter eggs thrown in, while managing to keep the tone desperate and depressing. Instead of slotting it in now, after the not great not really a finale finale of her saga, it would have been much more beneficial if the Book of Monsters continued. Heck, the **BOOK OF MONSTERS** is in your release!   \n\n\n**But I digress. A simple summary of what I've just said is:**\n\n\\-**The Queen was fine as an antagonist after the reboot and was set up well from the beginning of the game**  \n\\-**The inability to close out the saga or actually have a plan for it heavily hindered it up until its finale, or whatever that was supposed to be**  \n\\-**Malgor is dumb, stupid and dumb, and also suffers from a lack of character, because they forgot to give him that too**  \n\\-**Even if I don't like shadowidiot, you should stick to him because you started this mess, and someone has to clean this up before it gets out of hand**  \n\n\n**I guess Malgor and the Queen share something in common, being brainless. Basically, all this jumping around doesn't get you somewhere if it's not at the right time. After all, that's one of the reasons this game dropped so hard after Chaos Finale, isn't it?**\n",

And how much, if any, of that content can I get without paying money? I've set a personal limit for myself to only ever pay for ONE MMO, and I'm definitely not unsubbing from FFXIV to sub to this game. I'm hopeful that I can at least get a fairly good experience with this game for free, but considering the dragon amulet and the guardianship for the two aforementioned other games, I'm a little worried about missing out on most of the fun.\n",

It looks wonky on bulky or floating armors but that's not the point.\n\nIt would breath so much life into the game if a character could express themselves outside of dialogue boxes (which no one reads) and cutscenes (who everyone skips). A jolly character could /wave every time you entered and a sad character could /cry sometimes.\n\nWhat do you think? One drawback I see in this is the lag.

            "text": "Most of you will know how it works, **specific race damage boost** or **multiple races damage boost** ***stack*** with **damage boost to all monsters**, so NSoD, Awescended Omni Blades, BBoA or such **will stack** with other sources like SDKA, Polly Roger (since is **damage to all tagged monsters**, not damage to all monsters) or Head of the Legion Beast (40% more damage to Humans/Undeads and 30% more damage to Dragons).\n\nI'm ok with this bit, it's fine if they don't stack, however, something that many people may not realize is that **equipping** an item with **lower boosts** ***after*** will overwrite the higher ones, so equipping NSoD first and equipping AFDL after, **will decrease your damage** vs all monsters from 51% to 35%, since the latest one equipped is the one used. This also affects if you are using specific damage boosts, for example, Blinding Light of Destiny has a 75% extra damage vs Undeads, so **equipping** something with **a lower boost** to that race after (even if it grants damage boosts against multiple races, like what happens with Polly Roger), it **will decrease your damage boost**.\n\nAE already stated multiple times that this is **not a bug**, however, it's still incredibly annoying, since it forces you to **re-equip your whole set**, which paired with enhancements makes the game way less interactive, and goes against the idea of being able to change your outfit at any given time. That's why I really think they should change it **so the highest damage boost is always applied**, even if they still doesn't stack, or at least a \"Boost checker\" that makes you able to check which boosts are active at any time.\n\nI'd love to see other's opinion about this topic, and hopefully AE changes something to make it less awkward than what it is now.\n",

It's happened twice, like one 2 separate days. This affected all enemies.\n\nWhat is causing this? Bug? Server XP rate increase?\n\nI'm confused as I've just gotten back in to AQW after not really playing at all since 2014. But I personally like having this high xp rate as the game got super grindy after they made 65 the level cap. I remember always hitting it before it was raised until level 55/65 I got to 49 and then stopped\n",

            "text": "Hi, Void Highlord meme guy here again. Don't worry, tl;dr at bottom ;).\n\nI made a little survey that was supposed to shed some light on how many people are botting or have botted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/ndj3nv/which\\_of\\_these\\_best\\_represent\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/ndj3nv/which_of_these_best_represent_you/) .\n\nIf you assume that this poll of about 400 people represents the whole community (which is not that bold of an assumption), then 62.4 % of all players have botted before and 26 % are botting currently. I got very mixed vibes from the comments. There are people strongly against botting, and people who think botting is essential to enjoy the game properly.\n\nA game's sole purpose is to bring joy. If a loyal player of a game craves some external program or bot to bring the appropriate amount of joy for the game to be playable, something is not right. \n\nMany non-botters brought forth the argument that AQW is about the satisfaction of working for an item. That's is undoubtedly true. AQW has always been about getting rewarded for your hard work. I remember the day I FINALLY got rank 10 chaos with my Mage class after days of farming on my old laptop. I will never forget that feeling, because it encapsulates this game so well.\n\nHowever, the farmable items have grown more difficult and ridiculous to obtain with time. Their power has also considerably spiked. A lot of people in the comments also mentioned that the Void Highlord and Legion Revenant grinds are NOT mandatory. But, what's the point of playing AQW and not getting the most EPIC items? Who doesn't want Void Highlord or another cool OP class?\n\n\"Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody wants to lift heavy ass weights\" - Ronnie Coleman. This is where the problem starts. Every wants the items. but nobody wants to \"lift heavy ass weights\" because the weight lifting is just too boring and not worth it.\n\nDo you remember the Leprechaun event classes? What a joy it was to farm for them! You actually were having fun whilst playing AQW. They had all these cool minigames and you needed to stay focused and do your best if you wanted the maximum amount of rewards. Now, a lot of the farming seems dull and very repetitive, almost as if it was *made* for a machine. I mean, who wants to click skeletons until you have 40 thousand bone dust, so you can merge them into Tainted Gems, just for you to realize that you're not even 20 % done with the farming process? Easier to let a bot do the monotone work and have fun with events and other content.\n\nI get that AQW is not their main focus right now, but it should be! AQW is the game that made them famous and it is the most iconic of them all.\n\nWhat do you think? Is change necessary?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Many people are botting because of different reasons. AQW is about the satisfaction of getting an item, but the items are harder and harder to get. So people bot instead of doing repetitive tasks because they're boring. Is change necessary?\n",

Please no.\n\nIt honestly bothered me how Legion Revenant wasn't like this, when ArchPaladin came out before it, and seeing how great the grind was it frustrates me why the LR grind was so different. 1 was hands-on,you need to actually participate in the game to play, and you need other players to kill a boss. The other 1 requires you to get a decent class and kill mosnters again and again repetitively.\n\nThe principle is the same(killing monsters repetitively) but because you let the players become engaged at the game, it suddenly becomes more fun.\n",

            "text": "One of the most common questions both new and returning players would usually ask is how they can maximize the value of the 2,000 AC's they have. In this post, I will share to you on the best way to use them, so none of them will go to waste. \n\nBTW, be sure to check on your Account Page so you can get yourself a Bonus Package (if you bought an AC/Membership Package). You have a wide variety of options, all of which contain gear such as armors and weapons, sometimes even houses. It's all up to you on which would you choose. In my opinion, however, the package with the most value is Infinity Titan. It includes weapons, armors, helms, capes, pets, a house and a class variant. The class variant it has is a reskin of Stonecrusher, which is arguably the best support class in the game. It's effects also stack with a Stonecrusher if one is present in a room you're in. \n\nBefore spending your AC's you should do the following first: \n\n\u2022 Get Rank 10 in Doomwood and Embersea rep. You can search for guides on YouTube on how to increase your rep fast.\n\u2022 Pre-farm 200 Combat Trophies. Do this in a private room so you can do it faster.\n\u2022 Complete the following quest lines:\n       \u2022 Black Knight in /greenguardweat\n       \u2022 Snowbeard & Donna Charmer's quests in /tavern and /llama\n       \u2022 Do all quests in /willowcreek until you are able to see a Dwakel Soldier. \n\nAfter you've done all that, follow this in order: \n\n1. Buy Pyromancer from the Class Shop in the Game Menu for 2,000 AC's. Once you have at least 1 class point for the class, go to /fireforge and look for an NPC named High Adept Caustus and open the AC Pyromancer Sigil shop. Since you have Rank 10 rep for Doomwood and Embersea you will be able to get a Darkness Sigil and Flame Sigil. You can merge that for the Blaze Binder class, one of the best farming classes in the game. After getting the class, sell your Pyromancer to get 1,800 AC's back. Make sure to do this in less than 24 hours so you can maximize the sellback value of the class. \n\nEven though you can do this, I would rather recommend you to just do the dailies to merge for Pyromancer. \n\n2. Go to /underworld and look for Dage the Evil. Open his armor shop and buy Undead Warrior for 1,200 AC's. Once you do, complete Dage's quests from \"Undead Champion Initiation\" until \"Fail to the King.\" After that, sell back Undead Warrior for 1,080 AC's. Again, make sure to do this in less than 24 hours so you can maximize the sellback value of the armor. \n\nOnce you complete this you will be a member of the Legion. With this you will have more access to classes like Legion DoomKnight, Yami no Ronin, and Legion Revenant, and more awesome gear, especially in March during Dage's birthday. \n\n3. Get yourself a LightMage class that can be upgraded into Lightcaster, one of the best solo and support classes in the game, once you reach level 80. To do this go to /celestialrealm, talk to Aranx and buy an Evolved Lightcaster armor for 1,000 AC's then buy the LightMage class. It is a pretty good class as well if you don't have Lightcaster yet.\n\nNotes:\n\u2022 Make sure to do the first and second part in less than 24 hours. If you follow this guide properly, you could get up to 880 AC's, depending on if you do the AC method of Blaze Binder.\n\u2022 I do not recommend you to buy classes for 2,000 AC's because all of them are farmable and are not worth the value. Seasonal or rare classes, however, are okay if you choose the right one. I recommend getting Timeless/Immortal Dark Caster class during March or Abyssal Angel's Shadow during November.\n\u2022 I don't recommend spending AC's on Fortune Tickets and/or Treasure Chest keys because they are based on RNG. If you want to do it, go for it I guess.\n\nHere are other suggestions on AC items that I believe are worth the money:\n\u2022 Nulgath Birthday Gift (seasonal) is arguably the best Nulgath regeant farming pet especially if you plan on farming for Void Highlord and Enchanted Nulgath Nation House.\n\u2022 If you have cash to burn and have 6,000 AC's you can get calendar classes in /curio as they are the best soloing classes in the game. I recommend\u00a0 Shadowstalker of Time because it is well-rounded.\n\u2022 Bank pets cost 2,000 AC's and are made for convenience. If you have one you can just click on it and access your bank. Then again, you could just get a Bonus Package that has bank capes.\n\u2022 You can also get seasonal and event rares if you're into that stuff. \n\nThat's pretty much it. You can spend your AC's however you want. These are just recommendations on how you can make the most out of it. If you have other ideas or corrections, feel free to share them in the replies. Have fun and Battle On!\n",

            "text": "  \n**Spoilers for this week's release and whatever Queen related stuff you didn't know. But once again, who cares....**\n\n  \nAfter playing the most recent release in the \"Queen of Monsters\" saga, I thought it was going to be over. I thought I could move on from this character and acknowledge that although the saga had potential, it failed in execution through a series of changes and unfortunate timing. But I can't even do that.  \n\n\nI'll just state the problems since I can see those more clearly than the good parts of the release.  \n\n\n**Anka. Yes, Anka.** It's really hard to care. Like it actually takes a fair amount of effort to care. She's like, supposed to be more than the quest giver, but she doesn't really develop at all? I can barely call her a character, and I'm not sure if the intention was for her to be one, because I don't feel anything when she's dead. Heck, good riddance. She showed up for this saga, was the driving force for this saga, and died in this saga. Laguna, the MERDRACONIAN FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO, did this better, because the whole accept power, corrupted by power you can't control thing, although a recycled formula and basically the basis of shadowflame and all that, was newer in the chaos style. This feels like the exact same sort of thing, but I care less about the random human who wanted knowledge than the random merdraconian with a ship. Funny. I would go on about her being the antagonist but honestly? The antagonist of this story was me, trying to find a reason to play it.  \n\n\n**The Twins**. Do I even have to say much about this? While they weren't fully fleshed out characters before, they got a little better with duality plane (and a little worse in some ways) and really haven't had the chance to be important besides Xing's scuffle in the mirror realm. That sorta didn't really do anything. But I have the pleasure of saying that this release, they actually manage to make worse. The cutscenes with Drakath are filler, and instead of going towards all this info that Anka is saying, it goes to the Twins playing around with Drakath on their new cellphone. Those could have just been skipped if you just added Drakath going down the tunnel at the end of last release. Worst of all, they take away screen time from us, the protagonist, and Anka, the soon to be antagonist. **BUT THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING.** They don't help us fight, they don't report correctly to Drakath and they don't serve a purpose to the actual narrative. Comic relief can exist but it's a lot easier if you have it tied into characters who actually, I dunno, do something other than be funny-not-funny. Sorry, but they're just a shell of their former, chaos saga selves. It's one of the reasons why I question even bringing them back in the first place.  \n\n\n**The info**. The singular thing I thought this release was going to do was actually shed some light on the Queen and it did. It told us about her origins and how she came to be, and although it seems a little too out of the blue that she just happened to live without a heart for a few months and create a portal to another realm, a new plane of existence, I can overlook it because it's unique in its nature. A little convenient yes, but I've seen crazier and more spontaneous. But like Drakath said all this time, if she's dead why bother. And that was a question that I constantly have to think about. The hero doesn't justify their decision here, or stress why it's so important we learn about it. It just happens and we get roped into this mess. And what do you know, at the end of the release we have this magical plot device that can tell us what we need to know, and what do they do?  \n\n\nNot use a flashback cutscene? Wait what? Hold on. You're telling me, we used the somehow all powerful knowing device to confirm what Malgor told us about 2 years ago, but we still don't know what actually happened? And there's TIME SHENANIGANS INVOLVED? Why did we even bother, we have actually only learned info that while nice to know, doesn't help us in the future because the queen is dead. Or she should be. Who knows at this point. Hurts my brain to think about.  \n\n\n**The End.....?**  \n\n\nIt's funny how I played this and thought that I actually might have preferred a month of Malgor updates over this. Mainly because even though they will focus on him later in June, this just didn't feel like a story I wanted to play. Not because the hero was shoehorned into it due to plot. Not even cause the characters were definitely lacking. Mainly just because the majority of the release just felt like fetching simulator with Anka to get into this tunnel that was never mentioned and is just here now in a location that Drakath just so happened to build his castle on and doesn't have any prior significance to chaos like Thunderforge did and required a book that Drakath just so happened to have stumbled upon and secured that happens to know the way to this tunnel that Anka somehow just knows about.  \n\n\n  \n**The End (Summary)**  \n\n\nThe release does things amazingly. We're back to auto completes being standard, amazing map and monster designs and music quality is sounding okay in most of the maps. Most. But the actual story and content of the release. Can't believe I'm saying this but you might enjoy it more if you just skipped the cutscenes.   \n\n\nIn conclusion, if the Queen of Monsters isn't dead after this release, I'll make a post about everything that's wrong with the entire saga from start to finish. Including whatever bits were thrown in between. And I don't think I'll enjoy making it. \n\nIf it's too long to read, don't bother. It's just my opinion and who knows, maybe you liked the saga. But  there's problems and I'm not hesitant to point them out.\n",

I got 2 items from the awesomeness stuff, legion revenant and Necro (I know many of you are gonna be like why buy two farmable items wtf?!)\n\nSimply put, the grind for them is just tedious, I've played games like BDO/Runescape, grind doesn't bother me. The grind is this game makes it so anything like revenant you're gonna be spending hours in one day just getting one thing.\n\nFor example to put it into context, you need 20 spellscrolls for legion fealty for. You have to do the first quest 20 times for one item.\n\nNow, why do I say it's not worth it? Simply put, regret. It's really not worth it, you may want the items like I did, but in the end take my advice, don't do it.\n\nHope this persuades someone else from making this mistake :\\]\n",

Might actually be B tier at soloing. Your solo DPS seems to be very reliant on whether or not your last skill crits. I didn't really test out farming too much, but it seems to have pretty good sustain and damage (maybe A tier farmer, on par with Dark Lord).\n\n    As much as I don't like classes that play around with your health, it's kind of a fun mechanic how you have to play around with Psion Drain and Cerebral Siphon to balance your HP and mana (skills are not spammable). Overall decent class, just feels kinda weird to use.\n",

Simple gameplay, good character customization and loyal community.\n\n\n\nRS Classic is recommended a lot but honestly the art style and general gameplay experience is not the same at all. Say what you want about AQW's mechanics but its vibrant art style brought a lot of unique artists and characters together under a single game.\n\n\n\nFFXIV... close, but gameplay requires a lot of grinding and performance isn't good on laptops or shitty rigs.\n\n\n\nI played AQW since Beta and met so many good friends through it but it's been over a decade. We had a \"clan\" and forum with over 1000 people but like most online community's it's long gone over time. Wish there was another simple game that could foster this vibe... With mobile games and Steam it seems like there really should be something.\n",

That sounds stupid right? and the second one is that when I was farming a boss for a kinda rare item to get ArchPaladin, when I dropped the item, I couldnt accept the item but I could click on \"No\" to not accept it. I had to relogin, get the item again to accept it. I have passed throught a lot of bugs in that game and I cant find a solution for it. I\\`m not asking for a solution coz probably theres not. I just want to let off steam.\n",

I also liked that they're making use of the Elemental Planes once again. The movements of the characters in the cutscenes are nice too.\n\nI kind of think that the Hero and Malgor really have a connection of some sort. My theory is Malgor might be the Hero (us) from a future where the Queen has succeeded. Time travel is stupid, but the Hero did it multiple times already, and not to mention that the Hero is the Dragon of Time. In Doomwood Saga 3, Stellaria mentioned that it all started to happen when the Hero regained his/her powers back and that Artix dies from the Hero (final cutscene). Also in Doomwood Saga 1, Vordred planned to kill Artix to become the Champion of Darkness himself, but failed at it of course. So as to where the Shadowflame came from, I think when the Artix died the Hero gained the title of being the Champion of Darkness. About the techno undead thing of Doomwood 3, the only thing I could think about it is the virus that was hidden in /shadowvault and the Hero might have unleashed it, in turn getting infected by it as well. But since the Hero is also something else, those \"powers\" were merged and corrupted into a new form power, the Shadowflame. In Doomwood 3, it was never mentioned that the Hero was dead, just gone. Travelling back in time would explain that disappearance.  \n\n\nSorry about the post, it may kind of sound stupid, but I really needed to let them out of my head since I don't have anyone I can share em with.\n",

There is support for screenshot key (also for char pages), keybindings for usefull pages like the Wiki, design notes, account settings and char pages, and even support for playing in multiple windows, for alt accounts, or opening the original game (the non-aqlite, pure version) in another window. \n\nOur original goal was to bring Aqlite for linux, as browser support died, but we achieved so much more... We can now bring AQLite to Linux, the 32 bit variations of windows and linux, and even ARM! As we dont have a Mac for compiling, we cant provide a mac download, but **if you desire a mac version, we show how to compile one for yourself!** so dont give your hopes up!\n\nWe recently achieved version 1.0, and its all open sourced in github. Any problems or suggestions, just open an Issue there or send a message to me or u/askelam. We hope to save someone from having to go back to windows for aqlite or from staying in the artix game launcher (no aqlite) in their native platform.  \n\n\n**TL.DR -** Aquastar tries to bring AQLite and more QoL outside of the game to windows and other platforms. Links to download bellow.\n\n[Aquastar Download page](https://github.com/aquaspy/AquaStar/releases), exe files for windows, appimages for linux. Exe is an installer, so it can show up in windows menu later and AppImages are a local executable, just run it. Also, i386 versions are the same as 32 bits, if needed.\n",

We are AQW focused however we are slowly expanding into other games we share our passion of gaming in.

All we ask for is that you are active whether that is in-game or in our discord.

However, we do have players from all over the world. Be friendly. Be nice to each other and no trash talking is allowed. \n\n**How to join:**\n\nTo join in on the fun with us, join our discord server in which you will be welcomed by our officers who can invite you into the guild in-game.\n\n**Info:**\n\nGuild Name: Voices of the Extinct & Echoes of the Lost (Our branch guild)\n\nMy IGN: Kuros, I will be at Yorumi Yulgar-1024 when online \n\nDiscord link for those interested - [https://discord.gg/ZBAkkp7xnb](https://discord.gg/ZBAkkp7xnb)\n\nOur discord server is active and is ready to help any new players who decide to join us, we have dedicated players with the Helper role who you can ping at any time :)\n",

It's been explicitly stated that Captain Rhubarb managed to fix a couple of things, in regards to the \"Detsterrat Moya\" fix in relation to the big octopus-faced \"God of the Dead\".  \nSo, I kinda wanna talk about this: What in the world is going on with the developers? Honestly, is this some form of sadism that they're trying to integrate into the game?  \nTake for example Undead Raxgore from the Doom Vault B. He now has, apart from his skill locking and tons of HP gimmick the \"Counter\" ability, which can seemingly one-shot those who do not pay much attention when it comes! Now we have two Raxgore's with the \"Counter\", one with the temporary one that has quite the small window of opportunity, wherein you can only attack for a total of 9 seconds before Raxgore engages the \"Counter\" again. This discourages players from ever getting the Helm of Awe and if they do not time it correctly, it'll become quite frustrating! We are talking here about a boss who has nearly 1 million HP in tow and you decide to give him something like this? Come on, you guys, you can be better than this!  \nMy next gripe happens to be with Ultra Vordred from /join epicvordred. He now possesses the ability to transform any HoT into DoT, as well as stun with \"Shadow Grasp\". Who has even asked for something like this, to make these bosses all the more challenging ON TOP OF THEIR LUDICROUSLY LOW DROP RATES. Need I say more? These need to be removed, because it's practically displeasing and discouraging to the player base who are striving to obtain one of the Awe Items!   \nThis game is supposed to be enjoyed and to make farming more pleasing. Is this really necessary?\n",

There's way less incentive for me to buy and use AC's because I just won't ever use most of them to buy new sets since I already have a set that goes with my weapons, I just buy them if they're labelled rare and look cool enough.\n\nI doubt there would be some huge surge in popularity, a resurrection of AQW's playerbase, but I believe a lot more people would play semi-actively (At least weekly to check out any new shops or events) if they could actually get excited about new sets. Maybe I'm in the minority who are either too focused on min-maxing with NSoD, or just having it at all, but I'd personally love to be able to use my good weapons but not be locked into a specific colour scheme.\n\nAt the very least, unless it's a huge pain, just add it for the people who WOULD use it rather than not doing anything because most already do just swap through weapons.\n",

            "text": "**Note: Before you decide to call me a weak sob sister and tell me quit my whining: I have in fact beaten all three bosses for this release.**\n\nAQW just released three new \"challenge\" bosses designed to promote combat interactivity. Sounds like a fun idea right?  \n\nArr Ohh Enn Gee: RONG!! \n\nThese guys are the most abhorrent dogshit ever put together in gaming history. I could beat the Orphan of Kos blindfolded with a broken arm, I could beat Sword Saint Isshin in my sleep. But these Exaltia bosses? Let's go over what exactly they are, going from least cancer to most cancer. \n\nThe *last* boss, the Engineer, is actually the easiest. You just need to kill the two drones that accompany it fast enough that the defense one doesn't use its counter attack to wipe out your party, then beat the ever loving shit out of the Engineer itself. A little tricky if you don't have the right classes but can be done quite consistently when you get the hang of it. The Warden is a little more finnicky, what with its powerful shockwaves that heal it as it passes certain health increments. These shockwave attacks aren't too bad even though they hit hard, but the real killer is its petrify, which, if it petrifies your only healer in your party, you're fucked. \n\nBut the first boss, the one you're expected to beat before you fight the Engineer. Ezrajal. Jesus Christ. I've never fought anything so beyond bullshit in my lifetime. I'd rather have tried to solo Yagak in Outriders on the last expedition. I'd rather fight Weiss the Immaculate with no materia. To start off, which I didn't mention before, *all* rooms for these Ultra bosses are limited to 4 players. That's right, 4 players. Not 6, which is the average for most maps that have bosses that have over a million HP. And guess what, all three of these Ultra bosses *each* have 2.5 million HP. That's almost twice the amount of a buffed Immortal Chronomancer nuke. \n\nOf all three Ultra bosses, Ezrajal has the worst mechanics ever conceived in the history of AQW. The first one is his counterattack. Oh that's not so bad, you might say. All you need to do is to stop attacking him right? Well, sure I guess I could go along with that. It's just a shitty way to implement an invulnerability phase to draw out a battle and promote \"interactivity,\" and punish you if you don't pay attention to it. Plus, you have no way to end this invulnerable phase early. The second mechanic is his skill lock. The skill lock is, by and large, probably most punishing, unfun mechanic in the entire game. There's a reason why so many people hated Doom Eternal's second DLC, wherein the Cursed Prowler, once it hit you, actually removed your ability to sprint and dodge. Fun fact: once that happened, you had to chase it down through hordes of enemies and it could *only* be killed with a certain skill that hopefully you had charged up beforehand. But at least you can actually *kill* the Cursed Prowler and end the lockdown early; here with Ezrajal you're just helpless till he decides to release your locked skill. \n\nWhich brings us to his last mechanic. His *nukes* are the equivalent of miniature nuclear weapons. They are *unavoidable* and most appallingly, ***non-reducible***. That's right, you cannot mitigate his nuclear blasts in any way. Yami no Ronin, the king of dodges, cannot dodge it. Shadowscythe General's and Void Highlord's damage reduction are nil. StoneCrusher, Lord of Order, every class that has the ability to reduce damage for the party is useless. Legion Revenant's mana shield does squat. You will be forced to be able to tank not just his nukes, but *every single one of his attacks*, to the face, with zero protection. His nukes aren't so high, you might say. They only hit for, oh, about 2k-3k per shot. Which is, surprise surprise, the entire health bar of 99% of classes in AQW. See where this is going? You cannot dodge any of his attacks, but he can counter every single one of yours, in addition to locking down your skills. You will have to hold off your own attacks while he casually picks off every member of your party like an SS Commandant standing at his balcony picking off the Jew workers in Auschwitz with his Luger. Ezrajal, at his core, is an unfun, cheeky, cancer boss. \n\nBest of all, AQW in its current state is a near dead game, with much of the game and its classes being jack-of-all-trades, DPS beasts that rely on being able to spam all skills mindlessly. You'd be hard-pressed to find more than one player in any of the story zones, and all the popular areas with farmers are almost certainly bots. As a consequence, party-synergy is actually pretty much nonexistent save for buffing DPS. There are almost no true dedicated tanks (no tank in-game can take a single hit from Icewing), no true *healer* healers, all the typical RPG classes, etc. etc. You cannot even overwhelm this boss with numbers, since you're reduced to only 4 players. Guess what? Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft allow dozens of players in raids, and they can *all* still be wiped out by the boss. When an enemy monster can mitigate all your attacks with no way for you to counter it, can kill you with no way for you to counter it, and can lock down your *own ability to play the game* with **no goddamn way for you to counter it**, you've really done it. You basically killed your own game. \n\nTL;DR: Counter attack and skill lock shouldn't even be in this game, and *certainly not* in tandem with unavoidable, non-reducible, giga nukes.\n",

But first I suggest you guys to find eager teammates and try to solve their mechanics. So yeah let's start.  \n\n\nClasses : StoneCrusher, Legion Revenant, Arch Paladin and Lord of Order  \n\n\nWe literally used only these four to defeat them all. They are pretty straightforward and safe options.  \n\n\nUltra Ezrajal : Stop attacking when the counterattack warning appears (Press T). Only use supportive buffing/healing skills to sustain while getting hit. Then check the buff, debuff timer on the near of the boss to see if the stance is changed.  \n\n\nUltra Warden : Just spam I guess...? This was the easiest. (We literally tried it once or twice I don't really remember it)  \n\n\nUltra Engineer : Yeah... This one was quite hard not gonna lie. I was the LoO in the comp so I only focused boss while my mates take care of the drones. My aim here was to maintain my fifth skill's damage reduction stacks. But this alone was not enough we almost always died after the laser. We needed sustain but we were mostly support classes anyways... So we thought throughly and we decided on buying some health potions to use it after boss uses his laser attack. It worked wonderfully. We already had high haste but still we needed a burst healing after boss uses his laser attack. We didn't risk saving our healing skills after the laster attack because we were getting constantly damaged. So health potion in the embersea saved us gracefully.  \n\n\nTell me how did you guys beat them. I wonder what unique tactics you guys used. See ya all!\n",

They are just making complete fake accusations saying they have their game logs to back it up, which is complete lies. I think either they dont want to admit they are wrong or are just powertripping me. \n\nThe reason is a \"severe rules violation\". I made my guild name when I was a teenager and it was pretty stupid, its called \"m i l f t o n i u s\". I didnt think much of it but fast forward to now a staff member found it out and months ago they changed the motd to say something like \"edited the guild name as it violates the rules\". I waited for the guild name to change but a month goes by and nothing, then there is a whole misunderstanding because the the motd changes again says they changed the name to \"AE SUX\", but this was actually a member changing the motd without my permission. I assumed that was AE typing that and I replied with the motd joking about how it hasnt changed yet.\n\nNow that's all out of the way what they have been saying in the replies of the ticket I sent is absolute bullshit. They say they changed the name to \"m i l t o n i u s\" and that I quickly changed it back after. This is bullshit because I didnt even know how to change the guild name, didnt know you could, I was reminded by a friend that there was a free pass we got and I remember I put it in my bank. They even say their game logs backs up their claims but obviously that is lies. I dont know if their game logs are wrong or they are just doing this because they like to. I understand my name goes against the rules but they could have given me a temporary ban or even just bloody asked me to change the guild name, but they didnt. I've been playing since 2008 and spent alot of money on the game, I know they dont want to lose someone like me.\n\nThanks for reading, if you know how to help please tell me.\n\nIf you need anymore proof I can provide.\n",

One spot can be used for DPS such as Void High Lord strong confidence towards healers and supports.\n\nNote: Dodge classes or classes that reflect damage are completely ineffective.\n\nEnhancement: Powerword Die (can be helpful if you're lucky)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMust know mechanics in order:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. At intervals, the boss will unleash an attack that will heavily damage everyone. Immediately heal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. It is important that everyone is at full health before the periodic attack occurs a mentioned above because if a person is missing even a little bit of health, they will not survive the attack. As such, it is important to be constantly topping off health. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The boss will initiate a counter-attack stance, which you will see a prompt in yellow text saying that the boss is about to counter-attack. It is important that no one attacks the boss. Running away from it improves confidence that no one is attacking the boss during its counter-attack stance. After surviving the counter-attack, DO NOT IMMEDIATELY ATTACK THE BOSS. Let the boss attack you first because if you attack too soon, the counter-attack stance is still active when you would assume otherwise. Immediately heal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltra Warden\n\nRecommended Classes: Lord of Order, Light Caster, Stone Crusher/Infinity Titan, Archpaladin (or any support class with STRONG heals and damage reduction/damage debuff). One spot can be used for DPS such as Void High Lord strong confidence towards healers and supports.\n\nEnhancement: Powerword Die (can be helpful if you're lucky)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMust know mechanics in order:\n\n1. The boss can unleash an attack that will reduce everyone's health to 1 HP, referred as the \"Shockwave\" attack on the Design Notes. Immediately heal. Even if a player is missing health the moment the boss uses the Shockwave attack, it will only reduce the health to 1 HP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The boss can petrify/stun a player, so be ready to immediately heal if one of the healers is petrified/stunned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The boss can somewhat frequently deal large damage that is not the Shockwave attack as mentioned above. Immediately heal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The boss will become enraged when its health drops around 25% HP or less. Immediately kill the boss. Be prepared with supports that reduce cooldown because the boss will increase the frequency of the Shockwave attack. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically repeat steps 1 and 2 during  Ultra Ezrajal fight (but no skills are locked this time). For similar reasons, if a person is missing a little bit of health when the boss does a common attack, they will most likely die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltra Engineer\n\nMandatory Classes: Lord of Order, high DPS class (i.e. Void High Lord), and healing/support classes\n\n(The classes that were present during my experience was: Lord of Order, Void High Lord, Light Caster, and Frostvale Barbarian)\n\nEnhancement: Powerword Die (can be helpful if you're lucky and when the Defense Drone is down)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMust know mechanics in order:\n\n1. There are three monsters total: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, and Ultra Engineer. Before the start of the fight, moving forward from the spot where you enter will cause the Ultra Engineer to target you. It is best for that to not happen. You may move forward to directly attack the Ultra Engineer once the first Attack and Defense drones are destroyed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The general order to attack the three monsters go as follows: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, Ultra Engineer. Even after the drones respawn, attempt to attack in the same order if possible. If the Defense Drone is alive, the Ultra Engineer cannot be damaged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The Defense Drone has a counter-attack similar to  Ultra Ezrajal when its HP is around 25% or lower and a prompt will say in yellow text that the drone will counter-attack, so it is best to burst down the Defense Drone before the prompt appears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The Ultra Engineer periodically unleashes an attack that will instantly kill everyone. The only way to survive this attack (so far) is using Lord of Order's last skill \"Blessing of the Order\". The player using Lord of Order must use said skill the moment the prompt appears that the Ultra Engineer is preparing to attack. IMMEDIATELY HEAL. There is a high chance that if you do not immediately heal after surviving, the drones will kill you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Order of priority for each class:\n\n* Void High Lord: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, Ultra Engineer\n* Lord of Order: Ultra Engineer \n* Healer/Supports: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, Ultra Engineer\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this guide helps. Please note that this is not an \"end-all-be-all\" guide, just from my experience.\n",

If I understand correctly, 3 is the skill that is that is the one that deals a large amount of damage after 10 seconds (if 5 was activated first) in the form of a single  Damage over Time tick.\n\nThe questions I have are: \n\n1. Just in case, are past guides from years ago on this class still relevant?\n\n2. If skill 3 records the damage in a 10 second period, is it the skills or auto attacks that is being recorded that deals most damage (in the form of a single DoT tick)?\n\n3. Since 3 records the damage (if 5 was activated first), isn't it optional to try to spam 2 and 3 in that 10 second time period?\n\n4. Is the 5-3-4-2 the hard gold standard? What I mean is that if I want to do big damage, I must always wait for 5 to finish cooling down then proceed with 3-4-2?\n\n5. During the time that 5 is still cooling down, is there even an optional damage rotation? (It seems to me that 3 is ready to activate once before 5 finishes cooling down.)\n\n6. Assuming character level 100 with highest non-member Lucky enchantments (level 100 Mama Vamp), what is the DoT damage range if one combo was successfully completed? Do subsequent combos increase the DoT damage?\n\nPlease note, I am using this for solo fights and not group fights. I understand that there are also other high DPS classes in group fights that are better than SSoT.\n\nThank you.\n",

            "text": "This is my final post as the last 2 had barely information and proof so I removed them. I can understand why many people did not believe me. People have had good experiences with support but that doesn't mean people can't have bad experiences.  \n\n\nI have been unfairly disabled for the reason of changing my guild name back to the one that was not allowed. Originally my name was not allowed by AE so they mentioned in the guild MOTD that they would change it for me. The problem is that I apparently changed it back to \u201cm i l f t o n i u s\u201d after they changed it to something else, however I can assure you that I did not change the name of the guild. I had changed the guild MOTD numerous times as a joke, yet an officer had also changed the name of the guild MOTD without any prior warning to myself or other members of the guild. Not only that he and other members of my guild have said that the guild name had never changed. They mention the game logs show that yet they have not even shown me them yet.  \n\n\nAlso, why the punishment is so severe regardless? Botting can get you a 3 day temporary ban, where this has rewarded me a indefinite ban. Also, why is it that botter's who have never spent a cent on this game get a temporary ban yet I have spent hundreds of dollars spent over 12 years and I get a indefinite ban for something I did not do?  \n\n\nAnd finally, on the website I found out that Guild Leaders are given 1 free rename coupon, and future name changes will cost 1,000 AC\u2019s. Yet I have not used that free rename coupon, I can definitely say I have not spent AC\u2019s for the Guild name either. Also stated is that \u201cPlayer support cannot change or reverse your guild name, fix typos, or take a guild name from one guild and add it onto another\u201d so unless there is some exception that I am not aware of, they cannot change it by their own rules regardless. Also said is that \u201cThe changed guild name may not show up in game until all the members of the guild re-login to the game\u201d, I can say that several members of my guild have not logged in for 30+ days. Heres proof: [https://www.aq.com/gamedesignnotes/aqw-apr2-nameupdates-8308](https://www.aq.com/gamedesignnotes/aqw-apr2-nameupdates-8308)  \n\n\nAnd to you AE, if this is the way you unfairly treat loyal paying members, in order to keep the sense that Artix never gets anything wrong, it says a lot about your character. And you have lost trust that several members had in your organization. \n\nHere are images of the emails going back and forth between me and support, and the time they changed the guild MOTD: [https://imgur.com/a/5N5fVZ0](https://imgur.com/a/5N5fVZ0)\n\nI think this is everything I have, please help get this message out there as I still do not have a reply from them. I will remove this post if it ends up as AE realising they have made a mistake and give my account back.\n",

            "text": "Alrighty, so I haven't looked too far into it, but from what I understand, AE released all the calendar classes for purchase with buffed abilities making them stronger than before and better than ever. \n\nIn my mind, this is a little backwards. I'm fine they release the calendar classes. I have a few of the og ones and don't mind sharing the love. However, I think the buffs to the classes is a little bit of a slap in the face to those who bought the classes years ago. Personally (and I may be biased), I believe the reworks of the classes should actually have the original skills and then the original classes should have the buffed skills. I think this would be fair as the original skills still are really good and would benefit a lot of players who didn't get the classes when they were first released. But also, it's not completely ignoring the fact that some players bought the classes years ago to have an edge on other players. This way they can still have unique, buffed skills that the new players won't have with the ac purchase class.\n\nI hope that makes sense. Anyways, please let me know your thoughts on the matter and whether or not you agree with me.\n",

            "text": "Half a year ago, I posted a rather scathing and tilted post on the (zero) depth of 'gameplay' in AQW post-2012 era development:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/kcvyc9/aqw\\_had\\_more\\_complex\\_bosses\\_back\\_in\\_2009/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/kcvyc9/aqw_had_more_complex_bosses_back_in_2009/)\n\nIf I was to look at AQW updates from 2013 onwards to 2019, the only common trend of change, WAS no change. The reskinned weekly 'events' being copy paste versions of the previous week with different (and after a few years, the same fucking art with the same monsters renamed) models/backgrounds. No new features had been added in years. Aside from somewhat improving class designs the game was pretty much at a standstill development wise as the game turned entirely into a fashion simulator\n\nWithin this past half year we have seen two particular updates drastically improve the game finally, and show genuine upward trajectory in what really matters in an MMO\n\nA) The awe enhancement update. The importance of this update went really understated in my opinion. How buffed these were and all 5 enhancements finally having unique uses of their own and introducing metas beyond 'Spiral carve everything' added build diversity, and more importantly patched glaring holes in basically every non endgame class that made them at the very least usable if not actually useful. Which considering this applies to a good 95% of classes hugely improved the diversity of practical gameplay that doesnt have you run out of mana 2 femtoseconds in or get twoshot with a nonhealing class\n\ne.g. Horc Evader with the 45 mp Enrage skill on warrior regen model - previously the class was so mana starved you essentially played with 3 skills and Enrage was effectively cosmetic, now with mana vamp this class can actually play as intended, juggling your 3 buff skills with shadow strike.\n\nOr Elemental Dracomancer - tanky, respectable damage but with literally 0 methods of sustain. Now with health vamp you can actually enjoy using this class for more than 6 seconds/against bosses that don't die in 6 seconds\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd \n\nB) Referring back to my post 6 months ago, the devs finally decided to fix the very pressing and for eons forsaken issue of absolutely every last one of the thousands of monsters in the game being the same fucked thing - a lifeless hp sponge.\n\nRegardless of how poorly designed or hastily assembled the 'skillset' of these 3 bosses are, the more important crux of this update - that they have skillsets at all is a damn hallelujah honestly. I pretty much wept internally when I got oneshot by the counter attacking ezrajal for the first time, it was glorious. Thinking at all is something I miss from AQW. And AQW does in fact have room for facilitating thinking, flash engine, 10 FPS and all:\n\nCounter attacks like Alteon/Ezrajal = mechanic demand of halting attacks/disengaging the enemy\n\nLedgermayne's area attacks = mechanic demand of moving around the map. This in particular has serious potential for some skill floor\n\nManticore's poison removable by a button = (admittedly shallow) mechanic demand of clicking on, uh, buttons. This could be creatively made a little bit harder\n\nMonsters affecting the attributes of other monsters like Vath/Stalagbite, or Escherion/Staff of Inversion = this one is really awesome, mechanic demand of target prioritisation and management. Already done pretty well with Engineer, but looking at Vath the devs could really push this one real far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmongst many other more abilities that could be creatively mixed to add legit strategy and coop potential. For example, Kathool's regeneration shield - with numbers fiddled here and there, this could oblige parties to specifically save their nuke skills and time them to destroy the shield asap lest the boss heal back too much health. Or like with Warden and the 1 hp reduction ability, perhaps you have a monster that follows this ability immediately with a single target nuke and you require a tank class with a taunt (such as Dragonslayer's Bane of Scales) to draw aggro and avoid having your DPS or Support get oneshot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut regardless. Whether AQW's devs do manage to utilise their existing tools to the limits, or whether they churn out comparable content to Exaltia, the simple fact that they have finally decided to focus on QOL once more, and reemphasise improving actual gameplay and mechanical elements, leaves me optimistic, immeasurably moreso than the rather nihilistic hateboner relationship I harbored for this game in pretty much the entirety of the last decade. \n\nAnd one day, if I'm feeling seriously delirious and ever overestimate my own personal wealth enough, I might just support this game again and buy a damn 40k AC package. But thats a distant, distant future, and my wallet is faintly stirred but safe for now.\n",

However, it was recently BUFFED. The class that hits harder than VHL *without support*... got BUFFED. WHAT!?\n\nThat's blatantly pay2win, and that sucks!\n\nBut it gets worse! They removed the 40% heal cap and made it so most abilities don't consume Temporal Rift stacks. This means I no longer have to make choices about when to nuke, when to heal, or when to save rift stacks (Example: Save rift stacks to heal after Ezrajal's counter+nuke combo). The class is now a spammer like every other. This update has made it less interesting to play.\n\nBy comparison, I've found niche uses for pretty much every class in AQ3D except Rogue. I'm not here just to praise the vastly superior AQ3D, but to ask AQW dev's to be more reasonable about... Well, everything. Have some standards! I can't even count on 2 hands the number of \"time\" classes anymore and have no way of previewing the classes before choosing 1 to buy with my saved Hero Points. Personally, I would've condensed everything into 1, MAYBE 2 or 3 better designed and fun Chrono classes and just had all the other variants reverted into armors. Then, when you buy a calendar class, you'd have access to the same classes as any other \"Chronomancers.\" Why have so many? Well...\n\nIt's obvious that AE is doing all this in the interest of profits, even going so far as to make the new release all about Chronomancy RIGHT AFTER these classes were proven to be some of the most effective against the new bosses. Now, if players could at least earn like a free Chronomancer variant, this might be OK. But nope! Intstead you get 3/5 Hero Points if you were already active.\n\nI don't know how AE could fix this mess, but I just wanted to vent my thoughts on it all. It's bad.\n",

Now I'm happy I got my account back but this whole support thing is terrible, not only were they unhelpfull the whole way through until I got Alina to help they were lying the whole time too. Even in the last message they told me I could have my account back if I promised to not change the name back. When I got my account back I went to the account manager and got solid proof I never changed it, I hadnt used my free change as you have to use that if you want to change it. I believe the support was offended by the guild name so they decided to lie about me changing the name, its a clear misuse of power and support really needs to be looked into. Especially the one I was talking to (will not name them). Alot of people have had really bad interactions with support some never getting their accounts back. This needs to change.\n",

Excellent for classes with bad mana regen like the popular CDK. Fixes  classes with warrior regen model even before the mana vamp rework was released.\n- 40% crit chance\n- and a whopping 80% crit damage. This alone makes  the class worth it on using it as a support.\n\nSure, if you only have this class alone supporting the entire team, their performance would be mediocre at best. But when paired with other top tier supports like LoO, SC and LR who can provide an excellent haste buff and additional crit chance, your damage dealer's dps would skyrocket.\n",

Just comment in a calm manner and give me your opinion! :)***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't answer the question \"whats the best for solo\" or \"what should I buy\" because its different on each individual case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But heres the method to find out what you need:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore you purchase a chrono you have to pay attention to **4 things (at least)**\n\n\\- Chrono DPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Nuke cooldowns\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The classes you already have\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The role you want to play\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you divide chronos to 3 main category, then you get:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Chronos that are fast, but low DPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Middle category\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) High dps but slow\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you are a first time chrono buyer:**\n\nI recommend to buy something from the top of middle category: Corrupted chronomancer (fast and great DPS)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you already have a chrono:** Immortal or 2019 chrono, (anything that nukes high) you should go down to the \"low dps but fast\" type of chronos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where you have to pay attention to the **chronos individual niche uses** (*totally fine to decide based only the niche use*):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Timekiller:** dodge based solo class can be used to kill high DPS bosses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Chronomancer prime:** 80% crit chance on nuke, but it has no sustain, can be used to kill any normal (DPS) boss really fast\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Commander:** Taunt / debuff chrono, it's going to keep your party alive meanwhile it deals DPS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Chrono corruptor:** Rng based chrono, it has the speed of category 1, but based on RNG your dps might go up to middle category.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **SSoT:** damage is getting better over time, it's insane and well rounded , but it takes time to outperform other chronos (if you stop the combo you lose your DPS) top 1 for chainkills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Infinity knight:** It has some potential but its overall weaker compared to other chronos. (Buff it please! \\^\\^)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Eternal chronomancer:** Its a bit weaker than 2020 and 2019 chronos, but this is the most flexible chrono (temp rift stays active for a long period of time) so you have time to even switch maps between kills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Underworld** and **Corrupted** chronos are the best overall classes to buy if you want something thats great at everywhere. Corrupted is a bit better. (in my opinion) Great DPS, fast. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Chrono dragonknight:** The class is pure dps. It has no sustain and cant be use for solo, but the party DPS is godlike... like... GODLIKE!  \n\n\n\\- **Nechronomancer:** This is a really fast, and powerful farm class.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nIts your decision to choose whatever you want, but I hope this helps a bit.  \nGive me your opinion! You like it? What would you change? :)\n",

On my old computer, the software had the option to collect multiple copies of the same drop at once in a box in the middle bottom of the screen (ex. Bone Dust x111, Undead Essence x52). Now, it's the same AQW layout where all the Bone Dust x1 notification pops up on the screen (x111) vertically and blocks the middle of the screen. \n\nDoes anyone know the fix to this? Sorry if the question doesn't make sense, it's hard to describe.\n",

And since I don't run a YouTube channel...here you go.\n\n# Chaos Rift Strike\n\n\\-Deals damage to the target and applies Chaos Rift to you. Stacks to 4 and lasts 30 seconds.\n\n# Split Causality \n\n\\-Applies a small or large HoT to yourself, and a small or large DoT to your target. The small effects last 8 seconds and the large effects last 2 seconds. \n\n \n\n* Applies either Restore Time, a small HoT over 8 seconds or Mend Time, a large HoT over 2 seconds.\n* Applies either Time Bleed, a small DoT over 8 seconds or Time Hemorrhage, a large DoT over 2 seconds.\n\n# Time Collapse \n\n\\-If Chaos Rift is active, deal damage to your target based on the amount you've dealt in up to the past 10 seconds while it was active. Damage scales with each stack of Chaos Rift and consumes those stacks. \n\n# Don\u2019t Blink Twice \n\n\\-Deals a large amount of damage to your target and applies Distorted Time to yourself, increasing your Haste by 20% for 15 seconds. Chaos empowers you, either applying Visceral Shift, which increases your outgoing physical damage by 100%, or Shiftburn, which increases your HoT and DoT power by 100%. Both effects last 5 seconds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's important to ALWAYS have Chaos Rift stacked on you at all times in order for \"Time Collapse\" to deal damage (as it deals literally nothing if no stacks are applied) while dealing as much damage as you can for a short amount of time. For this, I recommend this\n\n    Combo:\n    1-4-2-1-1-1-3 (Maximum Damage) \n    OR\n    1-1-4-2-1-1-3 (Safer Option)\n\nLike I said, it's important to always have Chaos Rift Stacked, so using your first skill in every fight is a must so that it still counts in the \"Time Collapses\" 's 10 seconds. In order to maximize your damage, you first would need to have 1 Stack of Chaos Rift, followed by your 4th and 2nd skill. What this does is that the first stack would count the damage coming from the 4th and 2nd skill (doesn't matter if you get Visceral Shift or Shiftburn. Just follow the combo as normal). After you've dealt as much damage as you could (or just having 4 stacks of Chaos Rift) within 10 seconds, quickly use your 3rd Skill in order to deal the Nuke damage (or if you're lazy to count, look at Split Casualty's Cooldown. If there's only a quarter/3 seconds left, then that's less or on point of 10 seconds. If that is still too difficult, just remember to get 4 stacks of Chaos Shift)\n\nThe class performs well in both Solos AND Groups. The spammable skills and decent heal allows it to farm, but I don't recommend it. Avoid using this class against hard hitting bosses as it lacks any defensive Buffs or Debuffs aside from healing.\n\nThings to remember:\n\n\\-Your timing MUST be precise. If 10 seconds has passed and you have not used your 3rd Skill, you will deal immensely less damage. If you used your 3rd skill too early, then you will also deal less damage\n\n\\-I recommend Luck Enchantments. The more damage you do, the more the 3rd Skill's Nuke will bring\n\n\\-There's a very weird bug where you would instantly deal 1M damage to a target with your first (basic) attack. I don't know what causes this, but let's keep it between us, shall we?\n\n***Note:*** The class isn't amazing, let's be real here. It's still a decent Chrono Class and can still perform really well but it lacks more on what the others do and don't have. I only bought it for myself since it's Chaos. But AE, if you're listening, from a person who despise your work ethics: Please do the right thing and buff Chaorrupter. It's the least you could do after ruining Chaos (and only giving us 3 Chaos Classes)\n",

How do i know that? Because its the latest class the newer the class the better it is they try their best to create new chronos as best as possible so people would buy it. Ofc they wouldnt create worse chrono than they created before than we woudnt buy it because it wouldnt make sence to buy worse class. Also it depends on you if you want to farm or kill bosses. Btw those classes are not realesed so you should save up your points for those classes! :)\n",

After a 1 year all my friends stopped playing while I continued. This game was always about boring grindings and repetitive button mashing.\n\nThese bosses in Time Inn changed everything. I gave it a try after 1 week(?) of their release and holy shit they are hard. At first it kinda annoyed me because, like most who complained, I couldn't do everything by myself. But after changing rooms and servers, I've met 2 wonderful players who were in desperate need of a support class. We discussed class combinations, each boss strategy, and similar stuff. For the first time in ages I was excited to defeat a boss and feeling like in a true MMORPG, where comps and strategy matters.\n\nWe know AE screws up a lot of stuff and they are very lazy sometimes, but these last two updates were excellent and really brought my interest back into the game. They probably don't visit the subreddit, but, if somehow one of them do, I want you guys to know that you nailed it with these bosses, congratulations.\n",

I just wanted to share this strat with everyone who is struggling to get their insignias and wants an ez strategy that doesn't require luck like the PwD strat. All u need is a party with LR, CDK, SC, and AP/LoO. The LR and CDK focus the defense drone so the CDK can prestack while the SC and AP/LoO focus the attack drone. Once both drones are down, the CDK runs up to the Ultra Engineer and presses 4 -> 5, killing it in 1 hit. This strategy is pretty reliable, and we call it \"8 Sec Engi\". Just posting this here in case it helps someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: This is not from my PoV, my friend recorded it for our guild chat.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/omeruc/video/w68zxw1osub71/player\n",

I swear I have once seen someone using the class Void Highlord (IoDA) but I have never seen it again so I'm not sure if I just imagined it. My second question would be is it worth to claim the darkside class? now that the seasonal new version is out it feels like a waste but darkside is still rare so im not sure. Finally, does anyone have any cool suggestions for items not normally thought about? Besides classes, I would be most interested in armors or pets\n",

First Class Entertainment at /LegionArena\n\n2. Legion Loyalty Rewarded\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst Class Entertainment: \n\n1. This quest is good for those players that has dedicated friends or if you got lucky and you are in a room full of people.\n2. This quest also needs a good fking luck to turn in, because the quest item drops at like 4% drop rate. In my experience in under 2 hours I only got 1 axeros' brooch which is really unlucky of me, but sometimes I can get 360 in 2 hours.\n3. Sometimes the RNG Gods likes to mess up my luck and gives me nothing for almost 4 hours.\n\nLegion Loyalty Rewarded\n\n1. This quest needs a lot of grinding as it takes more than 5 bosses to kill, but it will only take like 20-30 seconds depending on the class and level you are.\n2. This gives 100% 5 legion tokens per turn ins.\n3. I tested this quest for 1 hour. I completed the quest for approximately 4 mins and 30 seconds. If we will compare this to axeros' brooch, you will get 120 Legion Tokens for 1 hour and 40 mins.\n4. This quest will also be needed for farming Legion Revenant as you will need these for farming the Diamond Token of Dage.\n\nThat is my notes for grinding Legion Tokens for Non-Members, Now I am wondering if there are anything that can help me decide which is better, I would gladly read that, Thank you!\n",

Lets all do this through proper channels if we really want something done about the problem.\n\n(TLDR) To everyone: I hope we can all play our part in reporting him to the mods and spreading the message. Simply spend a couple of moments in Artix server room hopping in ultraengineer and you'll very likely find him afk in one of the rooms.  If he is there, report him and describe the situation.

So for example if you equip a +5% damage item first, then equip a +3% damage item, you're only going to benefit from the +3% bonus and not any damage boost from before. \n\nHowever, different boosts can be used together (ex: reputation boost from cape, damage boost from weapon, gold boost from helm) and active timed boosts will stack with gear boosts.\n\nhttps://www.aq.com/lore/Guides/AQWBoosts\n",

Click *Let's go* and J6 will ask you one more time. Once again, click *Let's go*. You and J6 will travel to **Hyperspace** (/join hyperspace). Hyperspace is not a locked zone, so you will be able to /join this map. Once you get there, go to the VR room and click on the screen.  \n\n\nAfter the cutscene finishes, go speak to H.A.L. in the Command Center and play the Memory Challenge mini-game. You will need 1000 points in the mini-game in order to defeat H.A.L. The mini-game consists of looking at a series of pictures and then picking out the one that wasn't shown. You have as much time as you want to remember the images, but you must reach 1000 points before the timer runs out. If you are having trouble getting through this mini-game, try writing down what the items are, or taking a picture or screenshot of the items.  \n \"\"\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been running through both maps to see if I missed something but I can not start the minigame, my VR screen says \"Offline\" and H.A.L. just says \"System Offline\". J6 tells me to speak to HAL in hyperspace, and he just takes me here when I speak with him in hyperium. Watching cutsene from hyperium also takes me to this map.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something or is there a chance is it currently bugged?

I have played AQW on-off since 2008, and I haven't seen ever played like currently when doing the challenge quests. Since there's a limit to 4 players per room, you have to wait till you have a 4-room (which is not that long of a wait on artix, galanoth) and what's better is you actually have to co-ordinate with the people in your room. Never before have I actually had to type in chat to co-ordinate with my room. Things like when to apply buff before the fight, what class who is using (ie. lord of order, legion revenant, lightcaster, calendar class). Even though it's 3 daily quests, it's just nice to be able to go around rooms and co-ordinate with other players when playing the game. What do you guys think of the challenge quests and the way you have to fight the bosses?\n",

Can solo hard hitter bosses. generally - a tank supporter\n\nChrono Dragon Knight - good DPS, convenient temporal stacks, with a good team you can kill bosses at ease. Can end fights easily, generally - damage dealer >!(like the way sync intended it to be)!<\n\nI have to ask, which class is generally better? People have been mentioning that CDK is only good in group fights, so it discourages me to get CDK and instead go for Chrono Commander because of what it can contribute more, which is what bothers me since nobody gives the downsides of having Chrono Commander. \n\nSo if you have free time, just downright tell me your reasoning regarding CDK and CC and why the other is better or not. Also, if CDK is better how come no one is using it against bosses like the Ultra Engineer? \n\n(of course, if you have one of these classes, that would be much credible for me to conclude upon)\n",

Soloing (regular bosses)\nFor bosses that hit under 500, you won't need to pre-stack your 3-skill. You can just right away start with 2 than use 5, than two again (you have 3 stacks of Deadlock at this point, meaning that your next skill will apply it's Rift stack.) than 5 once again. If you started getting TR stacks, you're doing good, so max tham out. (4). Don't bother maxing out your IR stacks tho, as they have no impact on your damage. Than use 3-4 to nuke. \n\nSo, here's the solo (A) combo , assuming you don't miss/enemy doesn't dodge :\n2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-3-4 \nKeep in mind, that if you miss, Rift stacks won't apply. ONLY MAKE UP FOR STACKS IF 5 MISSES. DON'T BOTHER WITH 2. \n\nb. Soloing (bosses with 250DPS+)\n\nIn this case (and only in this case)\n\nPre-stack 3, 3 times, do the combo above, but now, make up for every missed stack, as they will help you sustain. \n\nc. Groups. \nBasically, \"a\" but with 13 million (my highest lol) crits. Again, don't bother getting max stacks of 2, or pre-stacking 3)\n",

Now you can no longer loop and you're forced to remove the buffs unless you want your DPS to be garbage for garbage compared to . CTT skill would negate some of the damage loss from the paradise self drawbacks since Its loopable and Timepiece of madness would almost guarantee a critical hit despite the crit chance reduction.\n\nHourglass of Paradise is 99% worthless on CCM and now 99% for UCM too (unless PvP but Idk who uses UCM for that lol). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All hail Hourglass of Transience!**\n",

I'm not just talking about the VHL guys in the ultra rooms for Apotheosis but also in other farms. While trying to grind for LR I found a room full of farming classes to kill Aeacus which makes no sense. I asked one dude to switch to LC so I can kill faster with a TK. He told me that Chrono commandant is much faster so I assumed he'd use it but all I saw was Blaze binder. I get that you're farming something but atleast use a solo/support class when it's a boss to make it efficient. Yes, I also tried to use LC/SC in that room but that compromised the Dps so much that I had to go back to TK. I'd rather deal with bot rooms where nobody responds than this tbh. For anyone interested in the class composition of the room, here it is\n2 Blaze Binder\n2 Infinite Legion Dark Caster\n1 Scarlet Sorceress\n1 Timekiller (me)\n",

Maybe LR is still arguably the best farmer class along with MoM and Nechrono but VHL is completely annihilated. Timekeeper just left VHL powerless just like VHL left Necromancer forgotten. I would love the idea of stronger classes with harder way to obtain. This free Calendar Class stuff has caused something like inflation of class power. But it is what it is, I got 4 accounts with a different Calendar Class each and I enjoy it. Thanks VHL for helping me to obtain LR, NSoD, SDKA, DoT, BoA, BLoD, Drakath Armor, you name it.\n",

The email was already confirmed b4 the account got hacked. I was 12 at that time and i have no idea how does the email confirmation works so i asked my friend to confirm it, But he forgot the password of the email which i was unable to recover. but luckily i was able to link it to my FB account.\n\nI currently have 1,6k acs and probably wait untill anniversary to get 500 acs so i can change name if possible. I also contacted artix support if there's other way without changing the name of the account or spending acs.\n\nI have a lvl 88 account (it was lvl 64 when my friend gave it to me) but this lvl 42 account always remain in my heart since this is my first ever aqw account I created way back in 2013.\n\n\nSorry for the bad English\n",

So, I was wondering, how should I spend these? I am not interested in rare gear and I already have SWoT , Crag and Bamboozle, I\u2019m already in the Legion and I already have Nulgath\u2019s Birthday pet. Also, I do already have a bank pet and have lightcaster. I have considered buying Sepulchure\u2019s Undead Blade but I decided not to. I already have a Naval Commander and one is enough. I am not interested in getting any other calendar class either. Furthermore, I have thought about spending everything on the Wheel Of Doom but arrived to the conclusion that it\u2019s a bad ideea.Also I don\u2019t intend to spend them on inventory/ bank spaces. I really don\u2019t know what I should spend it all on? Any ideeas?\n\nP.S: I did not pay for them. A friend of mine lost a bet and he thought that since we were both playing AQWorlds he\u2019d repay his debt this way but idk what to use em on.\n",

That's mostly how I find new (to me) maps. There was this one with really amazing backgrounds. I think it was called somnia.\n\nAside from that, darkon's saga, summer break, new recent releases, and the one with the purple dragon, I haven't seen much of the previous releases. \n\nI call em hidden maps cuz there's really no other way, that I know of, to access these maps unless you know their names, check the wiki, or maybe it's in the map. Kind of a shame so much content is just waiting to collect dust as these maps would usually be empty but ig that's how even the 13 lords of chaos storyline maps are nowadays.\n\nOh and pls no maps related to the chaos storyline after drakath becomes a feet-lick-begging beta simp (start of queen of monster storyline)\n",

            "text": "So i've recently just begun my AQW journey after 12years with a friend of mine, we are sitting at lvl 32 4 days in, grinding for reputation to get paladin class and necromancer. Kitsune was one of our favourite bosses back then so we had to buy the member upgrade because we wanted to look like him. I dont even know how but for 20$ each we both ended up with 9k AC so we have quite a bit.\n\nMy question is however: How do we spend it without ruining the game experience ? Let's say i just buy the best class i can in the game for AC then theres practically no more for me right? I still want the grind with getting new classes kinda.\n\nMy second question is: I was thinking if it'd be worth just buying mid-tier classes for AC? but then again most people would say that would be complete waste.\n\nThird question is: Should i buy cosmetics..?\n\nAny help greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n\\*Member + 9k AC\\*\n",

Idk if It's still possible to loop it or not present day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I know: The principle is that you build up your damage with the combo and by the time you hit the nuke, there is a delay before the Dot comes. At that time, you can reapply the rift which when the Dot Nuke arrives, it would be counted for the next nuke. Theoretically, if you pull this right, your nuke would exponentially increase in damage. However, I'll I'm getting is a constant 20 - 40k damage\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm doing and combo I'm using: Starter (2-3-5-2-4-3) then alternate between Single Nuke(5-4-3-2)  and double (5-3-4-2-3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see the Rift apply before the Dot however it isn't increasing. I'm attempting this solo so Idk if I need support or anything.\n",

Considering I have NSoD (and dual NSoD for enhancement flexibility between luck and wiz) this isn't much of a problem cause I don't need it, but I fear that this buff will affect the game greatly in the future, especially when people stop coming to those ultra bosses room making the farming even harder for future players.

The game was so boring with all the punching bag bosses, that required no planning, thinking, nor team coordination. This is the hardness what we deserve for endgame items, not the mindless dull 100 hour grinds we got in the past several years. \n\nI was begging for boss skills like this ever since the chaos lord saga ended, and I can't express how happy I am to see this implemented ingame.\n\nMaybe we will see something similar like in Dragonfable where they rework old iconic bosses and add them to their Inn challenge map to farm endgame items. That would be the best thing for a long time. (Not to mention the amount of content they can come up this way)\n\nI welcome aqlite merge too. Personally it will not change my experience because I have already use it for years, but im glad it will be available to every player as an official thing. Great thing!\n\nAbout the calendar class changes. With the wide and easy access to overpowered calendar classes, it was inevitable to see huge nerfs. I don't want to say much about since we don't know yet the final change. But I can see the reason why the devs do it and I'm 100% behind them. Most of theese original prebuff classes were very situational and underused anyways. And the ones who cry the loudest about the nerfs the ones who got it for free.\n\nI can see AE try to fix their mistakes, and try to do it in the best way. So stop complaining and \n\nBig thumbs up to AE!\n",

Dodge is better than damage reduction against OHKO bosses, a class that have this, and one of the highest nukes is pretty unfair. By nerfing the nuke and keeping the dodge, Timekeeper would still be the \"dodge chrono\"  and solo OHKO bosses but would sacrifice the high nuke for that (the class should still nuke, but not for as much as it once did). If they keep the nuke and remove the dodge, the class would lose it's identity IMO(why pick it when you could choose others who nuke harder?)\n\nSsot nerf should be applied on the spawm kill bullshit. I know, it's fun and saves a lot of time, but seeing it from a game developer point of view, would you agree with it? The rest of the class is pretty fair, high skill cap(most people don't know how to use it to this day) balanced with a good dps, the nuke isn't as high as the other chronoclasses and to get the best dps you have to sacrifice it's survivability(to a certain extent). Maybe I'm a but biased toward this class, but this spawm kill is the only thing I found \"unhealthy\" about it.\n\nDo you guys agree? What do you think about it? If it's nerfed, should be in this way or another way?\n",

After the nuke cap, I've found that the problem with the engineer battle isn't shredding the engineer's hp, but keeping the drones dead. TK's nukes still do full damage against the exalted drones, so with a team of TK, LR, SC/LC, and LOO, use the TK to 1 shot the drones, and get ~150k damage a nuke on engineer while the drones are gone. Even if drones come back, TK one taps the drones quickly, allowing you to beat ultra engineer without too much hassle.\n",

            "text": "I want to see what other people think are classes that need to be changed. I only have four classes I can think of immediately that deserve some love, so I'll share those. Let me know if you have any others.   \n1. Chaos Shaper.\n\nNot to be confused with Chaos Slayer, Chaos Shaper is a class anyone who purchases 15 months of membership can get. It used to be a fairly good class, but that was back when it released. Now-a-days it is feels less like a reward for players who show interest in supporting the devs and more like another random piece of crap to slap into your bank. I have nostalgia for this class, I used to love using it back when it released, and given how it requires 15 months of membership, I feel it should at least be comparable to Mindbreaker in terms of power. \n\n2. Bloodtitan.\n\nI cannot test the class now-a-days due to lacking membership, but as I recall this class was always fairly disappointing. It is more or less a proto-Scarlet Sorceress, using a similar model for its skills. However, it is meant to be a beefy tank. My main issue with the class is how absurdly low its haste is, meaning the time between every skill usage agonizing, and your DPS will always feel lackluster. \n\n3. Blood Ancient.\n\nA class that came out in the same era of AQW as bloodtitan, but it is a lot closer to the original Timekiller, a pvp orientated class that is more or less just a slight variation of Vindicator of They. Not very worth getting, and it was never particularly good even in pvp.   \n\n\n4. Legendary  Hero.\n\nThis class has always been awful. It is designed to be a party orientated support, however even when it  came out it was already outclassed in that regard. It has a stacking mechanic on its two skill that stacks 25 times (10 more than Infinity Knight) with a long cooldown, not to mention it also applies Focus on your target. This is not helped by the fact the class has abyssmal haste. What does this stacking skill work toward? A pitiful \"nuke\" skill that only crits in the low thousands (1-3k) at 25 stacks, and this is with Spiral Carve Apoth. Not only that, but it hits every enemy in your current room, meaning not only is the main target focusing you, but everything else in the room is if applicable. Don't be worried though, it heals you. How much? Not enough to make its  45 second cooldown worth it. In all fairness, its 3 and 4  skills are solid enough, however the 2 and 5 break any semblance of worth this class could ever have, and its rank 4 passives aren't really that useful. I don't know what I would do to this class, but at this point I would rather it be a reskin of another class than the class it currently is.  \n\n\nThat concludes my thoughts.\n",

            "text": "So I haven\u2019t played since they raised the level cap past 80. Been playing for a few weeks on and off and recently got caught up with the whole Chrono class issues. I had purchased SWoT and ICM with AC\u2019s back when they were released. I was still debating whether or not to save my HP\u2019s or just cash in, but after the recent nerfs the move is definitely to save them. I agree with those that bring up this as an issue , while mostly pertaining to past marketing strategies that AE took. \nThere was a point in time when all players recognized that these chrono classes were just busted. They all had flaws too of course, but the incentive to go out of your way to purchase their company\u2019s products just so you could unlock these in-game was there, it was supposed to be exclusive and available to only those who took the time and money out of their day to get them. \nFast-forward to today, and AE decides to give everyone a free chrono. Keep in mind that the whole reason this happened is due to a technical error on their end giving out 6 HP\u2019s accidentally and randomly. Their solution to their mistake was just to give everyone enough to get a chrono, which of course led to an overload of chrono users. It wasn\u2019t even a month before they realized that it was a terrible decision, and decided to nerf them all to shreds so that level 20 Chronomancers don\u2019t just cheese their way through literally all content. \nMy point is this, this whole process has been kind of a fuck you to the people who back in the day actually spent money for these things because it was being marketed at the time as being \u201cextremely powerful\u201d and \u201chighly-exclusive\u201d. I personally don\u2019t care about them saying that, as I said I play very infrequently, but I understand the perspective of those who are complaining heavily about the whole \u201cchrono scandal\u201d. Anyone else feel similarly? If not, how do you justify their actions?\n",

You can buy Endurance Draught and Felicious Philtre from /alchemyacademy, Potion of Evasion from /arcangrove\n\n- Endurance Draught. It gives you a 50% endurance boost which translates to around 33% more max health. Very useful for Ultra Ezrajal and Engineer. The difference is pretty big. Ultra Ezrajal will usually deal 2800 damage with his nuke, so after you get hit instead of having only 200-300 health you'll have around 1000. You won't get one shotted by his normal attacks after that. \n\nUltra Engineer's nuke deals around the same damage as Ezrajal but he'll also immediately hit everybody with a 1000-1100 damage normal attack right after it. If you couldn't time a heal between the nuke and his normal hit the whole party will be wiped out. This potion allows you to take both hits and still live.\n\nLord or Order make this potion even more effective. This potion is not effective against Ultra Warden because he'll reduce your HP to 1 no matter what.\n\n- Felicious Philtre. It gives you a 50% luck stat boost. Basically your already fat crits will become even fatter. Useful for Ultra Warden because you need to kill him as soon as possible\n\n- Potion of Evasion. Boosts your dodge chance and haste (though haste will most likely be maxed out from support classes). Also very useful against Ultra Warden when he goes berserk because it reduces the chance of him hitting you with a normal attack after his 1 hp nuke.\n",

But I'd rather prefer that, knowing that we will kill the boss effectively and without much loss. \n\nWhen I played FrostBarbarian, I can pretty much guarantee that you don't even need to press T when Ultraezrajal counterattacks. You can tank it and still survive, and I only died **'once'** in the entire 3-5 minutes it took us to kill the boss. Which is the best selling point in my opinion, thats without even having a single potion in use. If were to use Felicious phirite then I can guarantee that I wouldn't die even once.\n",

I don't know why this game gives me such a feeling of  insufficiency. I miss when it was simpler, the fun was so straightforward. Today with so many items, 10k chests of acs, hard farm, things just seem far away. Every time I go back to this game, expectations drop over the days and again I'm closing aqw to never return, until nostalgia calls me again, in another cycle of expectations. My account just looks bad, like it could be better. I would like to invest a little, spent some time, buy some nice items, but dollars is simply expensive. I wonder if anyone else feels that way, I miss simplicity, I miss simplicity so much from a game that marked my childhood that I would go back in time, just to rejoice in the simple things.  \n\n\nSorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my native language, and I'm a bit rusty. Just wanted to express myself. Atm I'm farming Legion Revenant, and forcing me to do that, to at least have 1 endgame item that makes me feel like I can enjoy everything else with a class that at least cuts my struggle in half. I'm at Legion Fealty 2 with four Conquest Wreath.\n",

I think it\u2019d be awesome if some of the really rare items we have could be made a nft on a blockchain. I\u2019m not too knowledgable of the tech behind this or anything but all I know is that would make aqw blow up all over again and would drive MASSIVE amounts of players to the game, especially since theyve been an established game for so long but have since be slowly sizzling out. I think it would bring back hundreds of thousands of old players and aqw used to be one of my favorite games as a kid and itd be dope to have a new reason to play it again with all my rares on my account i hoarded over the years. Even the #1 play to earn crypto nft play to earn game i play (Cryptoblades) creator has mentioned taking inspiration from the original Adventure quest in the rpg browser game style. Just my 2 cents. Do your research on the stuff a little, i think it could be huge for this game if they ever decided to venture into this new uncharted territory of play to earn crypto games.\n",

I do not remember all the quests I've completed over the years, but as long as I can **I am completely willing to help in answering any questions as long as I can check it.** Regarding the 13 lords of chaos, I've completed most places aside from Bloodtusk Ravine (cant kill khasaandra alone, and havent finished orc), Swordhaven (stopped at chaorruption rises cutscene), Mirror realm (stopped at the horror of chaos cutscene) and the chaos finale (did nothing in that). \n\n**According to the previous info, is there something I can grind that will help me out in getting a nice class?** If there is any extra info needed I can provide. I am so sorry if this is a post where you would think that I am lazy and did not do my research on classes, but whenever I try I find the best ever classes that I cannot reach right now like blaze binder or void highlord or something or like beginner lvl 10 or something classes like warrior and whatnot, and I am ignorant on the good places to farm for monsters . **I am also willing to spend my AC on a good class that will be worth it. I also forgot what most of my inventory items do, which is why I am asking for guidance on reddit.**\n\nI am sorry if this is a long and troublesome post, but I think that this is my first/second post on reddit and I do not know how things go here, and I came here to ask for help, so I do hope that the AQW community helps me out, and I am sorry if I typed something that might have offended you or incorrect, so please guide me and correct me my seniors, and ***I wish you a good day today whenever you read this, whoever you are, and know that I love all of you :)***\n",

            "text": "**Class Changes for August 6, 202**\n\nToday\u2019s update brings changes to a few classes that saw an unexpected power spike in PvP with the introduction of the Mythril PvP Amulet and Awe Enhancement updates. Additionally, we have also made adjustments to a few of the calendar classes and have given a certain Nulgath Nation class a much needed buff. \n\n\nChronoCorruptor/ChronoChaorruptor\n\nChronoCorruptor is already in a pretty good spot, but although its Visceral Shift and Shiftburn auras are powerful, they did not last as long as they needed to. These changes should increase the overall power of the two auras.\n\nDon\u2019t Blink Twice:\n- Visceral Shift Physical Damage increase: 100% > 75%\n- Visceral Shift duration: 5 seconds > 8 seconds\n- Shiftburn HoT and DoT power increase: 100% > 75%\n- Shiftburn duration: 5 seconds > 8 seconds\n\n\nDragon of Time\n\nTuning down Dragon of Time\u2019s sustain in PvP and increasing its overall PvE performance.\n\nDragon\u2019s Will:\n- Can now miss\n\nConvergence of Destiny\n- Maximum Discordance stacks: 20 > 25\n\n\nFrost SpiritReaver\n\nIn PvP, Frost SpiritReaver was incredibly dominant in most matchups. Reducing its stat debuffs and Haste passive should give classes more opportunities to combat it.\n\nSpirit Freeze:\n- Spirit Chill Haste and Dodge debuff: 15% > 10%\n\nSpirit Charge:\n- Fully Synchronized Spirit outgoing magic damage buff: 150% > 200%\n\nSpirit Banishment:\n- Spirit Damage Hit Chance debuff: 50% > 25%\n- Spirit Devastation incoming damage debuff: 30% > 15%\n\nSpirit Synchronization:\n\n- Spirit Shattering incoming damage debuff: 20% > 15%\n\nSpirit Chill:\n- Outgoing damage: 15% > 10%\n\nSpirit Blink:\n- Haste: 100% > 30% (total Haste still exceeds the 50% cap, but can now be slowed by many more debuffs)\n\nSpirit Reckoning:\n- Crit Damage: 30% > 50%\nInfinity Knight/Interstellar Knight\n\nInfinity Knight was lacking in performance compared to the other calendar classes, so it is getting a much needed tune-up.\n\nStat Model:\n- Changed to Mage\n\nStrike of Dawn:\n- No longer misses, but can\u2019t crit\n- Cooldown: 2 seconds > 1.5 seconds\n\nIncinerating Era:\n- DoT damage increased\n- DoT duration: 10 seconds > 6 seconds\n\nEquinox:\n- No longer misses, but can\u2019t crit\n\nNot a Second Wasted:\n- HoT and DoT Power: 12% > 30%\n\n\nSentinel\n\nThe new PvP amulet resulted in Sentinel being able to instantly deal a large amount of unavoidable damage, these changes aim to add more counterplay to it.\n\nSentinel\u2019s Strike:\n- No longer guaranteed to hit, but still always crits\n\nPurge The Wicked:\n- Damage increased\n\n\nShadowWalker/Stalker/Weaver of Time\n\nReducing the efficiency of ShadowWalker\u2019s infinite DoT scaling while reducing mana costs and greatly increasing the base damage of its skills. Overall, ShadowWalker\u2019s DoT numbers will be lower than they were previously, but the increase to the base damage of its skills should keep its performance at an appropriate level for a calendar class.\n\nRift of Shadows:\n- Base damage increased\n\nExude/Devour:\n- Base damage increased\n\nVendetta/Umbral Stigma\n- Base damage increased\n- Umbral Stigma DoT damage reduced\n- Mana Cost: 30 > 20\n\nSilhouette/Shadow Warp\n- Base damage increased\n\nShadowWalker has also received a few changes that are focused towards PvP. These changes have little to no impact on PvE performance.\n\nTemporal Eclipse:\n- Shadowed State no longer reduces enemy Crit Chance\n- Temporal Eclipse no longer increases Hit Chance\n- Turbulent Rift Haste buff: 100% > 30% (total Haste still exceeds the 50% cap on use)\nVindicator of They\n\nIn PvP, Vindicator of They is able to consistently stunlock its opponent, making it difficult to interact with. Therefore, we are adjusting its stun duration, but increasing its overall damage output.\n\nWe Want A Rock:\n- Petrify duration: 4 seconds > 2 seconds\n\nMass of Incandescent Gas:\n- Now has a 50% increased chance to crit\n\nHot Cha:\n- Haste: 20% > 25% (The Collector Class shares this passive with Vindicator of They, so they both got the increase)\n\n\nVoid Highlord\n\nVoid Highlord\u2019s current performance does not properly reflect the amount of effort that it takes to obtain it. These changes aim to bring it back up to a suitable power level, while modestly keeping it in check for PvP.\n\nContract:\n- At rank 10, now applies an aura called Abyssal Sacrifice to the target, which increases incoming physical damage by 5% for 8 seconds, stacks to 20.\n\nShackle and Unshackle:\n- Soul Void now increases HoT and DoT power by 30%\n\nHighlord\u2019s Gaze:\n- Mana Cost: 20 > 30\n\nArmageddon:\n- Arbiter\u2019s Wrath Crit Damage buff: 30% > 75%\n- Arbiter\u2019s Wrath duration: 8 seconds > 12 seconds\n- Mana Cost: 50 > 60\n",

THE EVER FLYING FUCK IS UP WITH THAT? These bosses hit like a fucking truck and have HP in the millions, so now you're stuck dedicating the entire team into low DPS healing classes just to scrape by, leaving you stuck in a fight for a goddamned hour while everyone STILL keeps dying over and over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck you AE. Keep your fucking badges, I'm fucking done with your so-called \"challenge bosses\". I'm so angry and disappointed with you, I don't want to slap you in the face, because that wouldn't be painful enough. I wanna strap you to your office chair and fucking MAKE you goddamn play your own fucking game for once. See if you still have such a hard on for these cancer bosses after dying to them 50 times in a row without even putting a dent in them.\n",

Arch pally will give dmg reduction, LC will give the heals, SC will buff the dmg of the party and LoO for its immunity(tips for LoO users use your immunity when Kala is about to use his DoT), LC can be swaped With LR if There is no LC\n\nIf you dont have a party i advice you to enter a room with one of the classes mentioned then tell the other people in the room to use the other classes, stategize your fight dot just bindly go in.\n\nThings to not do:\n\nDo not use VHL or any class with self dmg as the  self dmg which can kill the user when the Kala DoT is active.\n\nDo not use TK because Kala Deals dmg with DoT and evasion doesnt help with that and the dmg metigation can reduce the dmg of the TK nuke\n\nThats all, goodluck on beating kala\n",

            "text": "Players for a while have been wanting some depth to the gameplay in AQW, and the current game just offers two roles - support, and DPS, and that ensures you only ever need to have 4-5 classes that are the most usable in the game. A few for support, and the others for high DPS shenanigans. But, that leaves hundreds of classes in a useless state, and I understand that some classes are stepping stones to better ones, but hundreds of useless classes don't all serve that purpose, most of them are just useless.\n\nI feel like the sheer volume of classes in game limits their potential. A more interesting turn needs to be taken to breathe some life into the game. ***And to that end, since AE seems to be listening to their players seriously this month, I think it's time we from the community make it easier for them and provide them with ideas on how to make gameplay more interesting.***\n\n***For my contribution, this is what I propose. (This involves a lengthy setup and explanation, skip if you're not interested.)***\n\nThis is an idea inspired by the online MMO game, Dark Orbit, which isn't a great game to draw inspiration from in general since it has a history of not caring about its players, but nonetheless, here's my pitch.\n\nIn DarkOrbit, there are regular maps, and a set up special maps called Blacklight Maps, where the blacklight maps host a set of powerful foes that eclipse the enemies in the regular maps by huge margins. These enemies can be made easier to farm using special *blacklight* weapons that do more damage to them, and collecting more and more of these makes it easier to deal with them.\n\n***This is what I drew from the information I've provided.***\n\nWhat if AQW were to receive a Saga where the regular classes they use were very ineffective against enemies and the whole way we conduct combat needs to be changed?\n\n***Painting a picture through a story:***\n\nConsider this. A new army amassed by a mysterious force marches to Lore with intent to capture. Heroes of Lore gather to respond to the threat, and face off against a small fighting unit sent by their leader. As the fight begins, the heroes charge at the foes with every skill in their arsenal, but they don't even seem to be putting a dent on them. Defeated, Artix and his heroes retreat, leaving a few comrades behind, unable to save them. The mysterious force sets up camp in the outskirts of Lore, building their defenses in hero territory.\n\nQuest 1 Complete: Defeat Was Inevitable \n\nThe defeated heroes convene to discuss their future, and the best course of action to be taken against a foe much more powerful than themselves, or anything they could have ever imagined. The conversation turns bleaker by the minute, and just as hope dwindled, a mysterious figure appears from the shadows. \n\n\"With all your magic, skills and weapons, you won't faze this foe,\" the stranger explains. \"This is a foe beyond your world, protected by ***his*** aura. So long as his light shines upon them, they cannot be harmed by the best of you.\"\n\nThe heroes, weapons drawn, continue to humour the intruder - hoping to get some information from the exchange. \n\n\"I'm not your enemy. I'm a castaway - I do not serve him, I do not have his light. It is therefore in your best interest to listen to me, or you will be defeated by an enemy whose magic you don't comprehend. And trust me, it is in my best interests that you do beat ***him***. We have a common enemy - one that you cannot hope to beat without the help of my organisation - The Abyss.\"\n\n\n***Gameplay proposition for a potential new saga.***\n\nA new faction presents itself to us, one that promises ***hard-earned*** classes, ones that serve a very specific purpose, to do damage to the \"auras\" of this new class of enemies, without removing which, no normal class can do any substantial damage to them. These classes would ideally pair with normal classes to beat these foes, and when needed, stand on their own. This can also translate into some Legion, Nation, Good and Evil classes to get an upgraded Abyss version to help with this new challenge. \n\nA whole saga with gameplay that requires teamwork between Abyss and regular classes. One class does more damage to their aura, one does more damage to their HP. A Ying and Yang situation. \n\nThe Abyss classes' performance in regular combat I leave to the Devs. \n\n\n***That's my idea for one possible way to make gameplay a bit more multi dimensional and somewhat more interesting. Since AE are listening to feedback these days, I would like to encourage as many people as possible to present their ideas as well.***\n",

Recently, I came across this sub once more, and to my surprise, not only several classes have been buffed, but also every player got a free chrono class! This made me really excited to get back into the game once more, but since I run on a budget, I want to make those 6 HP really count.\n\nIt has come to my attention that we now have a new endgame weapon (Apotheosis) and two ultra bosses to beat in order to get it. Regarding the chrono classes, I've considered getting either TimeKiller, CDK or SSOT, since these appeared to be the most popular chronos for the bosses... until the patch kicked in and nerfed several of those classes.\n\nI wish to get a chrono to fill some sort of nieche that no other class can fill, however I already own all non Heromart endgame classes in the game: VHL, Legion Revenant, YnR, LightCaster, Dragon of Time, StoneCrusher and Lord of Order. I also got Eternal Chronomancer as my single chrono via 6k ACs. So in this context, is there a chrono class that outperforms any of my classes in terms of soloing or farming? (I'm also aware that 2 chronos are still to be released soon this month) Thanks in advance.\n",

So to vent out my frustrations, here are the classes that works (and are important) while explaining why, in the Ultra Exaltia Bosses\n\n# Support\n\nSupport classes are often split into 2 things: **Healer** and **Damage**.\n\n* Legion Revenant (LR): **Damage** Support. This class provides High Damage Reduction to the enemy, and High Damage Increase to allies. High Range and AOE attacks while dealing decent damage. Provides a mediocre heal\n* Light Caster (LC): **Healer** and **Damage** Support. Provides mediocre attack and defense buff and decent Heal. Can deal high damage as well. Single Target close range\n* Stone Crusher (SC): **Damage** Support. Provides high defense and offense buffs and debuffs for DPS. Deals mediocre damage that increases with allies. Single Target Close Range\n* Archpaladin (AP): **Healer and Damage** Support. Mediocre defense and offense buff but provides very high heals. Deals mediocre damage (if stacked Commandments). AOE High Range attacks.\n* Lord of Order (LoO): **Damage** Support. Provides high defense and offense buffs and debuffs. Also has a weak heal (yes, weak) and mediocre damage. Unknown Range and Attack (I don't know anything about this class)\n* Frostval Barbarian (FB): **Damage** Support. Provides high yet consistent buffs and debuffs with a mediocre yet consistent heals. Low damage, Unknown Attack.\n\n# Damage Dealers\n\nLiterally anything that deals damage. One thing to note is that these damage dealers a should be ***FAST*** as slow nukers (Like SSoT) is just bad.\n\n* Void Highlord (VHL): High Damage, especially in longer fights. Very consistent on self-heals and damage while being Tanky enough to even solo the bosses. Close ranged Single target\n* Timekiller (TK), Chrono Corrupter (CC): ***Fast*** Nukers. While they can't one shot the bosses, they are exceptionally good in bursting down Engineer's Drones and Engineer himself. Corrupter has an RNG based Heal that can help it surive longer while TK is a rick man's YnR. Can also be used against Warden (but good luck not getting Petrified). **NEVER USE AGAINST EZRAJAL.** Close ranged Single target\n\nSo far that's all the Classes ***THAT I KNOW OF*** that works. The Meta for killing the bosses are mostly 4 Supports. But it can change with Warden and Engineer as they don't disrupt offensive capabilities (but deals high damage anyways). \n\n4 Supports, or 3 Supports 1 Fast Nuker.\n",
