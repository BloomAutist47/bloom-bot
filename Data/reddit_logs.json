So here's the deal, I'm super unfamiliar with Nulgath farming, but I have a bunch of these pets for it and was wondering which pet I should use for each of the items I need (which one is easiest/fastest)...\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf45Here's the pets I have:\n\nCrag and Bamboozle\n\nDrudgen the Assistant\n\nNulgath Larvae\n\nNulgaths Birthday Gift\n\nOblivion Blade of Nulgath (rare)\n\nSword of Nulgath\n\nTendurr the Assistant\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf45From what I can see, these are the items I can farm with pets I'm pretty sure:\n\nGem of Nulgath\n\nUni 13\n\nThe Secret 1\n\nTainted Gems\n\nEssence of Nulgath\n\nEmblem of Nulgath\n\nUni 10\n\nDark Crystal Shard\n\nDiamond of Nulgath\n\nBlood Gem of the Archfiend\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf45Please let me know the easiest method for getting these and if I'm missing anything :)\n\nEdit: also, should I accept all the items for the wheel of chance or are there some that would be okay to blacklist?\n",
