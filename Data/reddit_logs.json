We value your safety and privacy above anything else. To download bots from this subreddit, go over to our portal website: [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/)\n\n**Firstly, you will need to download the Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7 application.** Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jozmg9/download_grimoire_38_pro_v177/) for more info on how to edit or use it. This is an exclusive service offered by our subreddit.\n\nOnce you have that, click Download Boots and search up the boot you want to run on the portal. Click on its name to download it. If you see a boot post on the subreddit, you may download it from there as well. Note that boots posted are approved by the moderators of this subreddit, and hence will guarantee their quality and safety. If you download a boot from a post in this subreddit, you will find virus scans as well. Make sure to upvote any boot that helps you!\n\nIf you're having trouble running a boot or would like to learn how to make edits in order to optimize it, use the [Grim 101 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9uke1qa0pzjAOTMUkasGR7Rqsz0fdOwdV0BaEzz0/edit) by /u/DragonTaryth. If you need assistance with a boot you downloaded, feel free to make a post on the subreddit, comment on the post you downloaded it from, or message us in one of our chat rooms. If you're posting on the subreddit, it helps a lot to take a screenshot of the part of your bot that isn't working. Just use a snipping tool.",

Moderators will go over your boot and make changes as necessary to optimize it as much as possible, and then upload it on the portal and send you a copy of the boot. When you have this copy, you may make a boot post on the subreddit, describing exactly what your boot does and instructions to run it and the like. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC4ceYgz8-ltXDKGw8hSPZIzywzwS3Mk4npYvCMiP7c/edit?usp=sharing) to find the boot post format and some other basic tips for boot makers to make your and our lives easier. If you have the permissions to, do make your comments section a live chat so it's easier to ask for any help needed.\n\nDo **NOT** post boot files on the subreddit. Doing so will be considered as a violation of the safety and privacy of our users and will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you post at least 5 good boots (before moderator edits), you can apply for a moderator position. You'll have limited permissions, but will gain more with contributions to our subreddit.",

You can also add the **Questions and Help** flair to allow people to immediately understand that you need help. If you can, make the comments section of your post a live chat so it's easier for us to diagnose and troubleshoot your problem.

            "image": null,
            "text": "**1. Why is my Boot not loading?** \n\nIf your boot isn't loading, this means you're using an outdated version of Grimoire. All new and recently made bots are made specifically for the latest versions of Grimoire, known as Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7. You can get the latest version of Grimoire from the Portal Site.\n\n**2. Boot keeps disconnecting?!**\n\nThis means your Boot Delay is very low. Most boots will have a \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command at the very top. You want to replace this with higher bot delay command. To do so, just head over to:\n\n    Misc -> Boot Delay -> (Change the number in the box to 10) -> Select the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command -> Hold Ctrl and Click \"Set Boot Delay\" -> Remove the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command.\n\nYou may now edit this command to a higher value such as 20 or 30 (by double clicking and replacing 10 with the desired number) if you're still disconnecting, but don't go too high as that would make the boot slow and inefficient. Some boots have a \"Set Boot Delay: 1\" command and those boots can be edited directly by double clicking.\n\n**3. Boot not working?**\n\nIf a boot isn't working, read the instructions on how to use the boot once again, if they are provided (they may be on the boot post on the subreddit or in the zip file in which you download your boots) before asking for help. Chances are you'll find your answer there. Furthermore, please take the time to read a guide on whatever item you're farming so you'll know exactly what the boot is supposed to be doing. If a boot stops without giving you the item you're farming, chances are it farmed all the required reagents and is waiting for you to turn in the quest yourself.",

You must have Grimoire 3.8+ PRO downloaded in order to run a boot from this subreddit.\n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD GRIMOIRE 3.8+ PRO:**\n\nGrimoire 3.8+ PRO is only supported by Windows. If you are a MacOS user, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPf1yVywKPk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n**To Download Grimoire 3.8+ PRO, you'll need either WinRAR or 7zip.** Once you have those, head over to our portal site, [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/), and click on **\"Download Grimoire\"**, which should automatically download it for you. Once you download it, you'll be able to run any boot you download from the same portal site. Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jghh66/download_boots/) for further information on how to download and run boots if you're new.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Grimoire 3.8+ PRO Exclusive Features:**\n\n1. **Selecting Multiple Commands:** Simply drag your pointer across various commands\n2. **Copying and Pasting Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+C to copy it and Ctrl+V to paste it below your selected line.\n3. **Duplicating Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+D to duplicate them.\n4. **Quickly Moving Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move them up or down respectively. You can hold Ctrl+Up/Down to move them several lines above or below also.\n5. **Adding Commands to a certain part of the boot:** Tired of adding a command and having it show up at the very bottom of the command list? Just go to the line above which you want to add the command, hold Ctrl, and add the command. For example, if you want to add a Kill \\* command above line 53 of your boot, select line 53, hold Ctrl, and add the Kill \\* command. It will show up in your desired position. (Actually a 3.8+ feature but very worth mentioning.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Advanced Commands (ignore if you're just a casual user):**\n\n**Index Commands:** Most lines in your command list in Grimoire 3.8+ PRO will have numbers next to them indicating which line it is, known as their index. You can add a command that makes the boot go to a specific index; or a command that goes a few Indexes up or down. You'll find Index commands in the Misc tab.\n\n**Integer Commands:** You can use a command to assign an integer value to a variable if you want the boot to remember information. Integer values can also be increased or decreased using commands. For example, if you want the boot to remember if the player is a member or not, you can make the boot go to a member only map like /nulgath, wait a few seconds, and set some variable (say, m) value as 1. Later on, if you want the boot to do something specific based on whether or not you're a member, you can add If Statement saying something along the lines of:\n\n    m == 1\n    Goto label: MEMBER\n\nInteger commands can be found in the Misc tab as well, and their If Statements can be found by going to the If Statement section and selecting Misc on the first line. You'll see Int is / Int is not / Int is greater than / Int is less than. There's a lot of stuff you can pull off with Indexes and Integers if used correctly.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut wait, that's not all!

(compared to SWOT) Reducing damage taken  only work for itself\n\n\\-no dodge bonus. I don\u2019t know when will I met a boss that one shot me in face but I know those exist in endgame/event\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSWOT\n\n\\+dont need to watch for skill's stack\n\n\\+5's 80% hit chance ensure 3 dont miss\n\n\\+dot make killing 'lower' HP bosses faster I guess (also something else doing damage if 3 misses)\n\n\\+More versatile\n\n?have 25% endurance.
