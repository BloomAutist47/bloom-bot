We value your safety and privacy above anything else. To download bots from this subreddit, go over to our portal website: [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/)\n\n**Firstly, you will need to download the Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7 application.** Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jozmg9/download_grimoire_38_pro_v177/) for more info on how to edit or use it. This is an exclusive service offered by our subreddit.\n\nOnce you have that, click Download Boots and search up the boot you want to run on the portal. Click on its name to download it. If you see a boot post on the subreddit, you may download it from there as well. Note that boots posted are approved by the moderators of this subreddit, and hence will guarantee their quality and safety. If you download a boot from a post in this subreddit, you will find virus scans as well. Make sure to upvote any boot that helps you!\n\nIf you're having trouble running a boot or would like to learn how to make edits in order to optimize it, use the [Grim 101 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9uke1qa0pzjAOTMUkasGR7Rqsz0fdOwdV0BaEzz0/edit) by /u/DragonTaryth. If you need assistance with a boot you downloaded, feel free to make a post on the subreddit, comment on the post you downloaded it from, or message us in one of our chat rooms. If you're posting on the subreddit, it helps a lot to take a screenshot of the part of your bot that isn't working. Just use a snipping tool.",

Moderators will go over your boot and make changes as necessary to optimize it as much as possible, and then upload it on the portal and send you a copy of the boot. When you have this copy, you may make a boot post on the subreddit, describing exactly what your boot does and instructions to run it and the like. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC4ceYgz8-ltXDKGw8hSPZIzywzwS3Mk4npYvCMiP7c/edit?usp=sharing) to find the boot post format and some other basic tips for boot makers to make your and our lives easier. If you have the permissions to, do make your comments section a live chat so it's easier to ask for any help needed.\n\nDo **NOT** post boot files on the subreddit. Doing so will be considered as a violation of the safety and privacy of our users and will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you post at least 5 good boots (before moderator edits), you can apply for a moderator position. You'll have limited permissions, but will gain more with contributions to our subreddit.",

You can also add the **Questions and Help** flair to allow people to immediately understand that you need help. If you can, make the comments section of your post a live chat so it's easier for us to diagnose and troubleshoot your problem.

            "image": null,
            "text": "**1. Why is my Boot not loading?** \n\nIf your boot isn't loading, this means you're using an outdated version of Grimoire. All new and recently made bots are made specifically for the latest versions of Grimoire, known as Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7. You can get the latest version of Grimoire from the Portal Site.\n\n**2. Boot keeps disconnecting?!**\n\nThis means your Boot Delay is very low. Most boots will have a \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command at the very top. You want to replace this with higher bot delay command. To do so, just head over to:\n\n    Misc -> Boot Delay -> (Change the number in the box to 10) -> Select the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command -> Hold Ctrl and Click \"Set Boot Delay\" -> Remove the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command.\n\nYou may now edit this command to a higher value such as 20 or 30 (by double clicking and replacing 10 with the desired number) if you're still disconnecting, but don't go too high as that would make the boot slow and inefficient. Some boots have a \"Set Boot Delay: 1\" command and those boots can be edited directly by double clicking.\n\n**3. Boot not working?**\n\nIf a boot isn't working, read the instructions on how to use the boot once again, if they are provided (they may be on the boot post on the subreddit or in the zip file in which you download your boots) before asking for help. Chances are you'll find your answer there. Furthermore, please take the time to read a guide on whatever item you're farming so you'll know exactly what the boot is supposed to be doing. If a boot stops without giving you the item you're farming, chances are it farmed all the required reagents and is waiting for you to turn in the quest yourself.",

You must have Grimoire 3.8+ PRO downloaded in order to run a boot from this subreddit.\n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD GRIMOIRE 3.8+ PRO:**\n\nGrimoire 3.8+ PRO is only supported by Windows. If you are a MacOS user, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPf1yVywKPk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n**To Download Grimoire 3.8+ PRO, you'll need either WinRAR or 7zip.** Once you have those, head over to our portal site, [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/), and click on **\"Download Grimoire\"**, which should automatically download it for you. Once you download it, you'll be able to run any boot you download from the same portal site. Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jghh66/download_boots/) for further information on how to download and run boots if you're new.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Grimoire 3.8+ PRO Exclusive Features:**\n\n1. **Selecting Multiple Commands:** Simply drag your pointer across various commands\n2. **Copying and Pasting Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+C to copy it and Ctrl+V to paste it below your selected line.\n3. **Duplicating Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+D to duplicate them.\n4. **Quickly Moving Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move them up or down respectively. You can hold Ctrl+Up/Down to move them several lines above or below also.\n5. **Adding Commands to a certain part of the boot:** Tired of adding a command and having it show up at the very bottom of the command list? Just go to the line above which you want to add the command, hold Ctrl, and add the command. For example, if you want to add a Kill \\* command above line 53 of your boot, select line 53, hold Ctrl, and add the Kill \\* command. It will show up in your desired position. (Actually a 3.8+ feature but very worth mentioning.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Advanced Commands (ignore if you're just a casual user):**\n\n**Index Commands:** Most lines in your command list in Grimoire 3.8+ PRO will have numbers next to them indicating which line it is, known as their index. You can add a command that makes the boot go to a specific index; or a command that goes a few Indexes up or down. You'll find Index commands in the Misc tab.\n\n**Integer Commands:** You can use a command to assign an integer value to a variable if you want the boot to remember information. Integer values can also be increased or decreased using commands. For example, if you want the boot to remember if the player is a member or not, you can make the boot go to a member only map like /nulgath, wait a few seconds, and set some variable (say, m) value as 1. Later on, if you want the boot to do something specific based on whether or not you're a member, you can add If Statement saying something along the lines of:\n\n    m == 1\n    Goto label: MEMBER\n\nInteger commands can be found in the Misc tab as well, and their If Statements can be found by going to the If Statement section and selecting Misc on the first line. You'll see Int is / Int is not / Int is greater than / Int is less than. There's a lot of stuff you can pull off with Indexes and Integers if used correctly.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut wait, that's not all!

So, in order to avoid further arguments and insulting, I will try to explain as narrowly and quickly as possible. So, there we go:\n\nSeasonal Rare rarity - items tagged with this are returning items; in other words, they come back into the game some time after they're taken out of the game ( most usual occasion, annually ). In aqwwiki.wikidot.com ( official AQW wiki ) site, these items are tagged with pink Seasonal tag. In short, if you see someone with an item, that's tagged as Seasonal, and you know for fact you can't get it now, don't feel bad, it will come back sooner or later, just keep checking  aq.com/gamedesignnotes :)\n\nRare rarity - now items tagged with such a rarity are going to be taken out of shops/monster or boss drop lists/quest reward lists. If you see an item pop up with a \"Rare Rarity\" tag in, say, Featured Shop, and you like said item, I'd strongly suggest you buy it, because, chances are, it will be gone in a couple of weeks. In AQW wiki, these items are tagged with a green Rare tag. If you find a guy with, say, a really good looking sword, and you check his char page, click on an item, go to wiki page, and it's tagged with a green Rare tag, you can forget that item completely, because you won't be able to get it anymore, unless you have it in your bank/you sold it and it was AC tagged ( that way, it's in your Buy Back shop )/you have a spare Item of Donated Awesomeness that you could use to get that item.\n\nAny other rarity items are pretty much available at any time that you may or may not wish to get it. Want to grab, say, a Phoenix Blade as a drop from Red Dragon in /lair? Go ahead. Either today, tomorrow, or two months from now, it will always be in it's drop list. \n\nHowever, there are ( though, very rare, but still very much real ) some items, tagged with \"Awesome Rarity\", \"Legendary Rarity\", etc. rarity tags, that, in reality, have gone rare. But these, as I stated before, are quite an uncommon case, so they can be called exceptions. In order to always be well informed about such items, I'd suggest you read Game Design Notes, Facebook or Twitter pages, etc. \n\nOne more rarity tag ( quite an infrequent tag, but it's becoming more and more abundant, and I will try to explain why further ahead ) is \"Pseudo-Rare\" tag. Such a tag is nonexistant directly in-game, but you will come across one if you browse in AQW wiki for some time. \"Pseudo-Rare\" tagged items are, essentially, also \"Rare\", although they are still available to a certain group of people. Items with such a rarity tag in wiki are ( or, to some people, WERE ) available by completing quests or from specific item-locked shops, that require certain rare items, like Infernal Caladbolg, buying them from a certain pet that holds a shop, like Collection Chests ( and, as there are more and more Collection Chests coming into the game once every while, \"Pseudo-Rare\" item tag is going to be more and more abundant and frequent, as stated above ), or a specific quest ( from a pet ) reward. Now these special items, pets and Collection Chests are \"Rare\", which means they are no longer obtainable in the game. However, the portion of people who still have said pets, can, in theory, still obtain these items, hence the \"Pseudo\" part of their tag. A quick example - the original Thanatos armor is \"Pseudo-Rare\", meaning that it's still available to people, but only those, who have the original \"Rare\" Paragon Pet and can still access it's quests. Another note on this topic - \"Pseudo-Rare\" tag in AQW wiki is a very similar, though lighter shade of green than \"Rare\" tag, due to it being very closely tied to items with a \"Rare\" tag. \n\nHope this helped some people understand how item rarities work in game :) Have a good one, fellas!",

            "text": "A timeline is a graphic representation of the passage of time as a line, or so I've heard (or searched up). AQW has some issues with time and I'm gonna tell you why. This will be a shorter post than normal, so maybe someone will actually read the whole thing. Who knows.\n\n1. Time doesn't start when we start. Or does it?One key issue with games that have self-insert protagonists is when a setting isn't properly established at the beginning of the game. You'll notice that if you actually head back to the AQW tutorial and play through it again, we just happen to be at the castle at the right time during the attack, which is the start of our adventure. Later you find out we're some powerful dragon dude who actually reset the universe and was living in between time. There's a huge, I daresay massive disconnect there. If we were the literal cause of the reset of the original universe, then when were we born as a hero into the world, how did we grow up in this world, what age are we, and were we alive during important events such as the rise of Sepulchure or the Queen's death or other things like that?\n2. In the year of whatever year they wanna say.Whenever someone mentions 2021, the first thing that would come to your mind is the year this is written in, 2021 A.D. of Earth. Now if you were to say that same phrase on Lore, well it couldn't mean the same thing as here, could it now? Lore is a completely different world that may seem similar in terms of time cycles and seasons to our Earth, but it has a lot more unknown elements affecting it. Simply put, you can't just say this is Frostval 2017, because 2017 doesn't refer to a year in which Lore exists; Lore isn't Earth so it doesn't necessarily follow our history. AQW has basically no past setting, or if it does, it struggles a ton to actually explain it well. You might brush over it, but since there's almost no records of official timelines being put together for the game, or even an estimate of how old the world is, it doesn't make sense for it to be 2021 in Lore.\n3. Seasonals for the seasonal season, or so I've seen.Seasonal releases indicate seasons, which indicates time change, which indicates a rotating axis, and yada yada basic planet stuff that most people can Google. Assuming that seasons come and go similarly to how they do on Earth, since they haven't given me a reason to believe differently, that means there must be a period of a year in Lore between a specific seasonal event, give or take a few days. This comes back to my last point, if there are obviously years passing between seasonal events, then when did this all start and in what year are we in now, that these traditions are customary?\n4. Side releases with a side of....release.Still on the years topic, if I went and helped the lunarmancer at Luna Cove (which was in the summer of 2015), then I decided to visit the Throne of Darkness (in the summer of 2016), does it matter what I did first? Not really, since they're independent from the main story, which is helpful but also a hindrance. By detaching certain characters completely from the main story and releasing an event at a certain time, it's hard to gauge when exactly that event happened without obvious cues in the release itself. Luna Cove doesn't really go anywhere after all, and there are heaps upon heaps of side releases that serve as some sort of weekly filler that I don't know where to place because of two reasons. One is that they just don't seem that important and feature characters who disappear into thin air in the next week. The other is that the hero, being a self-insert, is literally incapable of character development, lest we change our jovial, foolhardy attitude we've had for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12ish years now. You can't really see much reason in these releases, and can frankly place them anywhere on this hypothetical timeline, since it doesn't even develop the side characters shown in the release.\n5. Chronomancer? Nonomancer.By adding people who can just woah magically learn how to travel across time to change it however they please, you basically just mess up any semblance of normality you had with your already unstable timeline. Remember that part where Kezeroth got frozen in ice for a really long time (still doesn't indicate when the world was made btw) cause a chrono just popped in and said yes why not let's do this? Remember the part where they for no absolute reason other than a cool boss, insinuated that time has a reachable end and chronomancers can apparently beat the monster at the end? Attempt to recall the sheer annoyance of a Chronomancer whisking us away to a future we know nothing about, only to die to a wayward spear and leaving us behind to get home somehow. Does that not cause any sort of temporal instability in the universe, or was it just convenient to have Artix dead and we can brush it off with dragon of time powers that we can't use btw? It just hurts whenever they introduce random chronomancers into the story, which is why the only one with a decent backstory, Xeven, is probably the best. And she still has her issues.\n6. Lastly, why make us a dragon of time?Sorry if you didn't know about this part but I assume you've gotten this far with a few spoilers. We caused the reset of the universe by dying, and apparently we're getting our powers back for no reason, because that's what we totally need right now. Not even by making us the dragon, but by making us regain powers we literally shouldn't even know about due to them being in a past life which we had previously forgotten, they can just excuse anything that straight up should not make sense when dealing with time in relation to our character. Stumbled upon a village that's trapped in a timelock? Dragon of Time. Skilled Chronomancer tries to temporarily freeze us? Dragon of Time. Need more time in the mirror realm to stop a crisis? Sure I'll just freeze the entire universe indefinitely. It's like a gimmick that they don't even know how to use exactly, so they just apply it like a band-aid when attention needs to be diverted.\n\nBut enough of that. The basic summary is that if you're reading this paragraph, you either read everything and are considering it, didn't read any of it because you didn't feel like it, or you read here and there and get the basic gist of what I mean. The issue now is actually getting them to notice that there are longstanding issues with the world they've failed to build, and maybe patching those issues up is a job for now, or the next game.",

            "text": "I'm not a longtime player of the game, only happening to start up my account in 2014 after suddenly remembering the game existing due to a well-placed ad. But over the past 6ish years, I've had some fond memories with it and some not so fond ones. To make things clear and if you know me, you'll know this, I'm one of the least cosmetic focused people I know. Not to say I haven't purchased AC items here and there but I just don't really focus on obtaining items I know I won't use, which is why I won't be making arguments about cosmetic quality over the years. ~~That and I don't wanna reopen the Hollowborn discussions.~~ To put it short, here are a few of the issues I've had with the game itself and maybe a little as to how we got here.   \n\n\n1. Release quality. Let me paint you a picture. You had just gotten home from whatever education system you were involved in at the time and decided to boot up AQW. The year happened to be 2014 and you were excited to finally end the chaos saga and have the final showdown with Drakath. As you traversed up the mountain, the excellent synopsis of the events of the saga flashed you back to when you played each part the first time, obtaining and grinding different classes along the way. When you finally reach the summit, the slew of cutscenes unlike any other begin.   \nNow this is a finale of a longstanding saga yes, but the releases these days don't seem to have that sort of magic and effort put into them. I could even go more recent, into something as comical and enjoyable as Swaggy's Chateau and compare it to this year's recent Valentine's release, of which I can barely remember the name of. Sure the plushies were cute and frankly don't deserve to be bound to that forgotten seasonal, but you get my point; there just used to be something enjoyable about all releases, instead of them just being AC advertisements. Maybe it's just my perception changing as I grow up, or something else.  \n\n2. Music quality. Remember the Throne of Darkness. If you talk about music in AQW in any capacity, ToD is bound to come up in the conversation, as it's one of, if not straight, the best (and only) soundtracks in all of the game. Even individually, the atmosphere of each of the songs fit extremely well for the characters that they're related to, and I genuinely want to extend my thanks to Ghost for making such amazing pieces. But as they say, all good things must come to an end. AQW and DF have a history of mooching songs off each other, but after a while, you just hear the same old recycled tunes in different zones. Not saying every update has to have handcrafted pieces, but it has been a while since there's been a new one. Doomwood 3 surprisingly is the last instance where I can recall a song that wasn't previously used in the game. Or none of this applies to you because you don't even play the game with sounds on because they still haven't added a slider function.   \n\n3. Writing quality. I'll be honest. I've attempted to play every release in this game that's not just farming for stuff and I don't know if I regret it or not. I get a kick out of playing old side releases and making jokes about them to others, but there is just something different when you compare them over the past decade. I don't really know how to explain this but it seems as if the formula has changed, from having a linear storyline to a more cohesive one, and that's affected how we interact with characters. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just take a look at the >!Malgor saga as of now and you'll see some things.\nWe've gained a total of 4 allies, counting the Crownsreach Chaos Crowd as one of them with Drakath at the helm, and foiled multiple of Malgor's plots to date. The issue is, this story sort of lacks a clear direction, as Malgor has just become a villain who, like the Queen used to, orders some unnamed general to take care of things, unless you're Xing. He gets up in the mirror realm to do some stuff but frankly that entire story was a mess, tasking us to head back to the mirror realm to beat up Gravelyn who somehow got corrupted by Malgor + co. who got access to the mirror realm to find the Amulet of Order, a classic Macguffin that's so much of one it doesn't even have a design. This results in us assembling the Avengers from the past in the mirror realm to fight a threat that Brentan ends up somehow casting an all-powerful spell that literally banishes all unknown elements of the realm from the realm. And none of this has any short-term effects on the realm's instability. Amazing how convoluted one battle can seem, when the related narratives don't flow together well. Complicated isn't necessarily better, and if you play through even one Chaos saga story, or heck even Extriki's story, you'll notice that while the plot is linear and a lot simpler, it's still valid and interesting due to the characters and enemies themselves. Basic actions performed well can outdo extravagant ones performed poorly.\n!<\n\nBut yeah. In short, I could say the game sucked less than it did now, or I'm just not finding it as enjoyable as it used to be. I still do hope I could help in the future. If that's even possible. Let me know what topics other than cosmetics you find issue with. If it was about looks, we'd be here the whole year.",

We don't want another AQ3D. A game that didn't take off because most of the original crowd of AQW stayed in the game they had lots of progress in, money spent. Attachment.\n\nThis set up AQ3D to be harder to be successful as opposed to a adventure quest world's mobile port. Where lots of players will be carried over to start populating the game and getting it recognised. \n\n\nAlso there will not be much content for you at launch of AQ2D. they are porting Eveything. Having to grind again is going to maintain the playerbase early on, increase the game player count and popularity and will be a good way to keep the community busy until further new progress is made to the game. There will be nothing new and you will be moaning about that. We don't want the game to be inactive.\n\n\n If you want AQ2D to be as uccessful, popular and improve progress resetting is a must to bring eveybody back, as there will be not much to do if you have already gotten key items.",

Do they not realize, nobody is using the shit armors/weapons/capes/helms  they release because they are shit. I feel like AE doesn't listen to our feedback at all bcuz if they did, it wouldn't be so boring. \n\nOnce you criticize AE and their artists work on Twitter they take it as being rude and get all butthurt. Like no, Im just telling you \"your armor sucks and I'd rather you not waste time releasing it\". Artists like Darkon, Lae (with his trash hollowborn items that nobody wants) and Crulon honestly are used to ppl agreeing with their trash releases but me, I see past all the bullshit. Then wanna re-skin and recolor everything just to give us content, like bruh you could've used that time to come up with new ideas. I find it hard to believe that AE had months to plan for Nulgath Bday and could only come up with shitty seasonals and bad armors, same with dage, we got nothing new but the (tbh a very trash evolved) Darkside armor. Let's not forget how AE rather show love to a game (Aq3d) that is complete garbage and looks like 90's graphics, rather than improve their main money maker (AQW). GTA San Andreas graphics are better than Aq3d and Aq3d was made recently \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nNow let's talk AC's, there's literally no reason to buy them, or Membership. Nothing cool to spend it on and no perks other than member only quests.\n\nThen AE has the nerve to come up with a daily release system, which I'm thankful for but let be honest, once you see the tweet about the daily drops, it's not even worth logging on for. So tired of the childish helms and armors, give us something God Like or Angelic, don't wanna walk around looking like my account is owned by a 7yr old. Legion Titan still doesn't have a sword to match the armor, which they could take the sword from Legion Titans cloak and use that, but no they'd rather release unfinished sets. DragonBlade of nulgath still doesn't have a dragon like armor to match it.\n\nMe and my 8yr old brother could honestly draw better weapons then AE's artists. Guys if I missed anything let me know down below.",

It helped me throuhh childhood depression, when I used to be bullied in fourth grade.\n\nAnd it's kind of sad to see, that it's almost dead nowdays. \nSo just out of fun, I made a list, of what would need to change, to make the game poular, playable and fun, in 2021\n\nLet's start with the one,that personally bothers me the most :\n Nearly impossible farms, and required grinding : grinding should not be required to be a descently strong player. \nSome hardcore, god tier items, like VHL, LR,NSoD or BLoD would still be hard to get, but for example, I don't see a reason, for Shaman to require a grind. The thing is, that currently there's three types of players : people who are underpowered because they leak the time and patience to kill the same goddamn monster 69420911 times, the people who actually grind (~1% I feel like) and botters, who are just like the first category, but are overpowered, because they do get those OP items. \nAnd this is very wrong. The casual players NEED to be buffed. That itself, would stop at least a few people from botting. \n\nThe second great factor I think that needs a change is items. To be honest,minus the ultra hard to get NSOD and BLOD, items are just for the looks mainly. And this is dumb. Every weapon would need an impact on damage, PRE-ENCHANCEMENT,  ENH should only amplify it. At the current moment,most weapons are the same (minus damage range and looks),and this is a big issue, thag causes the game to be very boring. \nSame for armor. And I'm not talking about the class. The actual armor. That should impact defense and maybe even speed.\nThat would make the game much more complex, wich it needs, it's too simple.\n\nThis one would be enough to get me back into the game. But I'm courios, do you guys also have toughts like this? Can this be our AQ2D wishlist?",

Everytime something new came in, i just can resist myself for trying something new and left out my faith to stay on one armor sets that look nice. \n\nSo, i want to ask you guys is there any shadowscythe theme armor that look good bcs i really look into shdowscyhte (having crush on gravelyn lol), and i want the armor to have a good matchup with the Royal Shadowscythe Blade (the one that gravelyn use) bcs it really give you that \"im on the evil side looks\".

            "text": "If you have just started AQW and are getting familiarized with the game/community, there are several things you should know:\n- The game along with the community is dying\n- The devs are more or less just trying to find new ways to incentivize buying micro transactions for this 12 year old game.\n- all gameplay boils down to sitting around in a room mashing 4 buttons over and over\n- aqw is a dress up game where you mostly go afk\n- the story is filled with 2010 internet humor, which consists of shitty puns, silly names, and stupid gimmicks.\n- since the game\u2019s conception there has been a war about botting, which is simply using a script to mash those 4 buttons for you instead of you having to do it yourself. At the end of the day, AE doesn\u2019t care.\n- after all this time, the most popular aesthetic is simply \u201cedge\u201d, likely because everyone playing this game is either 13 years old or just wants to flex\n- it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll make friends in this game\n- With the death of flash, you\u2019re left with 3 options: using the shitty artix launcher, use a bot program, or use aqlite. If all of this still doesn\u2019t deter you, I suggest using either of the last two, depending on whether you care about the whole botting debate or not. \n- many of the games good looking or functioning items are rare, meaning that there is no possible way to get them without spending obscene amounts of irl money for a 12 year old flash game\n- there is a decent amount of elitism among anyone who\u2019s played the game for longer than 8 years, because they have tons of rare items that you can\u2019t get\n\nConclusion: unless you are willing to mindlessly mash 4 buttons for hundreds of hours, this game probably isn\u2019t for you, especially because you\u2019re new and won\u2019t have any way to get things that you would really like without an excessive amount of work.",

            "text": "Hardcore fan of this game, have been playing for 8 years now, sadly not on the same account (nostalgiaquest duh). My point is, I started botting 4 years ago now. I loved the game before that, obviously, but I just couldnt enjoy it to its full extent and there was only how much I could do. As a student, I would have never ever crossed my mind to even start farming for something that'd take me literally 5-7 months of hard, unrewarding and boring work on a daily basis. Problem is, the most exciting things in the game require this kind of farming, which might be ok to some people who have no life, but I personally just dont have the time to get these items manually, it'd be ridiculous for a very busy student. So, I first started botting in order to get VHL. I found out about botting programs, chose the best one, studied how it worked, and made the bot myself. It was fun, the sheer action of building the bot was fun, as an actual coding student it was just cool to get all these simplified commands and build something with them I could then use to get the items of my dreams in a game I love. So I made the bot and started it, and I found out just how convenient this is. This meant I could spend time studying or playing other game or anything while not losing time on farming on AQW, not only that, but it's three or four times faster than the manual way even with farming pets. I was amazed, and excited, very excited that I could finally get the items I had ever wanted and never could have gotten otherwise. It was an enlightning experience, and made me fall in love with this game more than I ever had. I began to spend a fair bit of my free time thinking about what I wanted to get, making item lists, calculating how much it'd take, how I'd build the bot, I learnt about code injections, plugins, loaders, grabbers and I actually keep on studying the game and all of its content, I even became a member (money for daddy artix!!) this month, which I would have never done had I not used bots. Bots saved my AQW experience, and a lot of other people's too, I'm sure. If you dislike bots, don' t use them, it's fair, you can spend your time the way you want. If you have the nerve and time to farm for SDKA manually, good for you, but don't blame people who don't. It doesn't hurt you, and it keeps this game alive.",

This adds up to 81.57% dodge.\n\nIt is important to note that Swordmaster also gets 20% Dexterity from Passive which most likely plays into the dodge calculation. \n\nCan someone explain to me how Dodge is properly calculated?  \nThanks",

So, here is what I have for my account \"Revan 225\":\n\n* Blade of Awe\n* (Ascended) Blinding Light of Destiny\n* Sepulchure's DoomKnight Armor\n* Drakath's Armor\n* Necrotic Sword of Doom\n* Legion Revenant\n* Void Highlord\n*  Dragon of Time\n* Yami no Ronin\n* Head of the Legion Beast\n* Many of the Legion hard to farm items I want, except for the castle house.\n\nFor legion I have most of the Paragon Pets including Bright and Shogun so LT items aren't much of a challenge, and for Nulgath I have the Ceremonial Void Knight Sword Pet so Nulgath farming isn't mind-breaking. Any suggestions much appreciated. Thanks!",

            "text": "So (haha) for those of you who played the release already, you probably know that its story is one heck of a doozy to follow through with. Despite calling myself a long-winded ranting Loremaster, I'm having trouble keeping up with it, and so I thought I should make a place where I can organize my thoughts and grab opinions from others, while also reviewing a walkthrough of what happens.  \n\n\nNow begins saga's story time: Kingdom of the Stars  \nAstravia: A Kingdom of wonderful red, red and more red. We don't know much about the place, only that it's located fairly close to the village of Eridani. We begin at (are arrested by guards and taken to) King Drago's Castle, which seems to be the most impressive building in the Kingdom. There we talk to Drago and his advisor about why we were arrested and what we're supposed to do. This is where it starts getting complicated. Drago is a little off his rocker and there's a revolt going on at his front door which he tasks us with stopping, along with a little virus going around. Just a small cough.   \n\n\nThat's the first part. Pretty easy to pick up from the cutscene, so won't dive into it at all.  \n\n\nNext we head to Kasper's quests. From doing these, you can actually pick up information about the situation, which I highly suggest you read. Drago's a tyrant who the people have wanted to revolt against, the beasts he typically summons haven't been seen for months, and this is their best chance at taking him down, despite his mysterious protection. It's a llttle hard to find, but Kasper actually evacuates the citizens once the creatures come in, essentially stopping the revolt plot immediately. Ti is the commander of said creatures and once we defeat him, it's implied that Kasper is able to evacuate with the remaining sane people. Or not. We don't really know, those things are deadly.  \n\n\nWhile this occurs, Ms. Advisor is sweet talking Drago into doing something really irrational, summoning something that's gonna keep the people in check. We get a little \"flash\" or flicker in the Advisor, showing that she might not be your typical secretary, but she manages to convince Drago to use the ritual by preying on his ego and childish attitude.   \n\n\nSecond part, or middle I'd say has a lot more going on. Kasper is a retired mercenary and says something about Drago offering tons of gold in exchange for all the hired dirty hands he can get his...hands on. This probably alludes to the title of the release, necessary sacrifices, as the Coronation of the Celestial could require many human sacrifices to function, and what better way to get people to go to their deaths than to use money? While Drago essentially believes he's protecting the people with his ego higher than Everest, in reality, it just robs soldiers of their lives, with the upside of being able to defend against threats impeccably; a necessary sacrifice he would call it. This causes general discomfort in the town and feelings of anger stir, which leads to this revolt after information gather. However, discomfort isn't necessarily the feeling you want when there exists a mind plague on the loose. Feelings of unease and suspicion have proven to be great soil for the entities to take over one, and the mercenaries are \"dispatched\" quite easily, causing the plan to go from infiltration to evacuation. Ti, one of the Scale, is apparently leading this attack.   \n\n\nFinally, a lot happens to be honest. After sparring with Ti and coming out on the upper hand, a girl named La comes and restrains Ti. We notice they both look similar in getup to Fa and Re, and congratulations, the Hero has met 4 members of the Scale, yaaaaay so fun! Busy being weirded out, Drago performs the ritual, most likely with all the souls we've slain still drifting around or maybe something else, the remaining townspeople, hard to tell. This summons the literal Moon in demon form, and the summoning ritual has us rush back to the main town. We beat up the moon, talk a little, take Drago into custody, hiding, away, whatever keeps him from being annoying on-screen, and Fa and the adviSor have a little chat, ending the release.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis part moves a little faster than I thought it would. La essentially comes to stop Ti or restrain him to prevent So's plan from working, or us being killed, as So's reaction to our presence implies she didn't want us to be here. We suppose to die, but not die. Drago realizes who La is and his brain puts two and two together, figuring out that Darkon should be alive. Once again, implies there was a situation that Darkon should have died in but didn't, and Drago knows about this situation. His first thought is to shout out how he's shielded by the Alprecha due to his status, and La doesn't really wanna hurt him for now, so she tells us to take him away. Then her chat with So leaves a lot to speculate about. Props because this 6ish box dialogue actually hints at a lot.   \n\n\nSo implies that La is the first, or one of the first members of the Scale due to how long she's served Darkon. She also says that Darkon passed away somehow, and she wants to give him the justice he deserves. Justice implies righting a wrongdoing, and since So's plan involved completely destroying Astravia from the inside out, it could mean that Astravia committed a wrong action against Darkon, or probably Drago or his family line did. La jabs back by saying that even if she was to completely destroy Drago and topple Astravia, Darkon wouldn't reward her for doing so, even though it's one of his goals. This leads me to believe  Darkon himself was wronged by either Drago or Astravia as a whole and seeks some form of revenge on it, although it may not be his main goal.   \n\n\nAnd then we have boxes with La after finishing the event on some of the things that happened. And dog tags. Fun fact, just about everything in this release has a chess reference stuck in it of some sort, from the NPC names to the quests, to even Drago's blanche outfit fitting the white King. Actually quite amazing when you look into it, as some of the quest names relate to the actual quests themselves.   \n\n\nOverall this release gives a lot to speculate about for the future and is also interesting itself, with many plot points and conflicts occurring simultaneously. My only gripe is that I feel as though the release is actually too packed with plot points and it runs the risk of being too complicated to understand due to so much being packed into only 4 cutscenes and a few quests.   \n\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Just play the release yourself and take from it what you will. It's pretty good, I'd say...",

Her story is good, something I was looking forward to learn more about, but she's dead already lol. \n\nThen there's Malgor, the all war dude. I don't even know what he is since the \"bosses\" he's been sending out are far too weak and story-less (does that make sense?) compared to those we've battled from chaos saga and qom saga. \n\nSo yeah, I just want to let that out because I'm getting disappointed with the story lately, though that Nulgath/Malgor alliance really left me lots of questions.",

Is sword master the best way to proc powerdie for non-members (fastest aa with thief enhancements for haste)\n4. Would luck be the best enhancement for powerdie damage or is theif better for more haste, thus higher chance to proc it?\n5. Does anyone know if darkbloodstromking rank 10 passive is based on abilities used or auto attack and the chance?

            "image": null,
            "text": "It's as simple as the title says. AQW has trash punishment for cheating and something needs to change. A permanent loss of account for mentioning cheating vs a 3 day for actually doing it? I know there are some AE staff who check this place so what the heck is up with this? You mean to tell me I could mention the word bot in game and be met with a worse punishment than the actual action? If that isn't pathetic, I don't know what is. You punish the action not the word. Who even thought this was okay? If actual cheating gets you a temporary time out, maybe that's why nearly everyone does it? No wonder people treat the game as a joke. \n\nI'll offer a possible change. AQW is a game where items you have play a big role in how good your account is so get rid of the whole temporary account timeout and remove illegitimately gained gear and also restrict the account from accessing the actual quests to farm for said gear for a yet to be determined period. Simply put, if you bot, you can't farm for a while. \n\nIn addition to this, make grinds less annoying. The DoT class farming was done right. You had to work with others to finish and near everyone had a decent time with it. If all endgame grinds were like this why would anyone bot? You'd be doing everyone a favor. Instead we are almost always given these endgame grinds which are the crazed antics of a lunatic shoved at our faces. Kill this 1 million hp boss that can one shot even a whole party for 20 temporary drops that you have a 1% chance of getting and when you turn in you have a 10% chance of a reward. Of course I'm exaggerating but this is the kind of bs we're given. Is time not a factor considered here? Why has this game forsaken fun in endgame farming? There should be satisfaction in completing a goal but there rarely is any. \n\nWhen you have arrogant quest designers, a combat system that promotes or even encourages cheating added to the struggle of entertainment vs responsibility it's no wonder the most logical response is to cheat. Especially when doing so doesn't negatively affect you. So what's it gonna be? Are you going to do something or is cheating the new norm as many already seem to believe it is?",

            "text": "In the light of the recent smatterings of bannings, botting has again come to the forefront of discourse. It's been the elephant in the room for a long time, and now it's become very topical. Fair enough. But I have some issues with this that I wanted to air, and some clarifications about, personally, the nature of botters, and why collective unity is the best way forward.\n\nI see people actively victimising others now, and I won't deny that I've partaken. I've done the \"viciously beat the shit out of someone using reddit\" option, and it's been neither satisfying, nor helpful. Some legit players are acting like their entire arthritis grind has been vindicated by the latest 'bot purge'. Okay. It takes about 4-5 weeks using an automation program to max another account. Most people have accumulated tens of backups. It doesn't hurt, there's no grand chink in the armour, what you should be looking for is what helps heal AQW.\n\nI'm writing this to not so much the legittors, as the *anti-*botters. The people who invest their entire reason to be on the subreddit into insulting botters, on crowing and preaching absolute moral high ground because their entire reason to exist in the r/aqw space has been validated at last by a handful of grainy screenshots depicting a ban message and an endless yellow wheel.  I just ask you to think: what are you celebrating? Why do you infer that botters are bitter about the bans? Why do you infer that we're  mega upset, when in reality, it's an occupational hazard and some of us just feel like posting because it's something we have to share. It's pretty once in a while, no one is 'crying' or whatever. Now, a useful conversation piece? Could be, if certain people didn't jerk off their \"shoot the messenger\" egos. Here's a message for you. Don't lurk around waiting to be proven right. Just wait for an opportunity to make your view heard in a constructive way. When you're about to write something, ask yourself if this is going to really advance discussion, or if it's just another mud-slinging. The last thing we need to do right now is be distracted with eachother, when AE's recent appointments signal at least a temporary interest in this subject. We need everyone, but we all have to be fighting for a better AQW. Believe it or not, botters want that too. Don't carefully craft the cruellest comment possible. Instead, just say what you disagree with, why, and what your suggestion would be for fixing even the tiniest part of the game. The person you're talking to has had maybe 5 minutes to think about what they're about to write. Things can be gotten wrong. It shouldn't matter if what we all are building towards is a better AQW. Remember that your one-size-fits-all treatment of botters as scum might not come off so well if we're going to be future players together once AQW gets fixed. So, to end this with? It's not about vindication. It's about the changes AE needs to make.\n\nHere is a great opportunity to start talking as comrades. There needs to be a reminder - Botters are players too. Some may do it to recapture nostalgia. If you think cheating is adverse to the point, just remember it's a game which has let botting go unpunished for a long time. \"The point\" is relative to the perceiver. And it's none of your business to infer moral judgements on the perceiver, because enjoyment of the game is how they make it, and if botting figures, then no problem. It's something that AE need to reckon with, not something that you need to bully the living shit out of someone for, because that doesn't solve the problem, it just adds more dynamite. Right now, we don't need black and white thinking, because AQW hasn't given us any to work with. The last time we had black and white thinking, AQW lost a significant chunk of players. At the time, they not only shot themselves in the foot, they eroded a portion of community trust. And it's happened more since. One example, two words: Server Rewrite. And we all agree that their social media policy as a company is crappy and deliberately myopic. \n\nAll of this.... is not something to blame on botters. Stop projecting a stereotypical cheater concept on us when in reality, it's been the anti-botters who have been doing more to hurt the playerbase. In recent times, the derogatory language from anti-botters is at a hysterical high. You can scream all you like, but botting is what has kept AQW on life support. If you think botters never pay, find some evidence. I can't restate that enough. Find. Some. Goddamn. Evidence. Just playing legit doesn't instantly put you in the high ground, because the point of the debate is that all participants are equal and have worthwhile points. We're not asking for Cysero to be beheaded or anything so there are virtually nil fringe ideas bouncing around.\n\nAnother thing. You have this misguided idea that botters are supremacists, botters are narcissists, botters are creeps, botters are repulsive. Here's some news. We're not nearly as vocally oppositional as you lot are. I've been on the discords. The anti-botter ones are vastly more bitter. It's such a backward mindset to have because we badly need to try being united right now. At the same time, this mindset is by no means exclusive to anti-botters, for sure, but we have a lot less \"bad apples\".\n\nIn summary, I'd point out that resolving a situation like this takes time, and some accountability on AE's behalf. If we unify though, we can bolster and refine the currently weakish common point on this. Some highlights include quest incentive, particularly the sheer numbers of hours/monster kills. Everyone thinks that sucks, and if you think that botters are pansies for thinking that NSoD is not worth manually grinding, then you're exactly who I'm trying to beckon to this discussion. Please, reconsider your moral assertions, remember that AQW has gone through changes, and that actually, the NSoD questline is absurd. Hundreds of hours into a pixel game - you don't find that a little stupid? Given the historical lack of enforcement, people have felt free to bot it. But drawing moral assertions from that isn't okay. Let's try uniting as a playerbase, because AQW's reckoning is here, and we can all do something together.\n",

            "text": "Some things need to change so that we have a coherent standard regarding what makes a good set and what doesn't in order to address the blatant mediocrity of many sets I have seen posted here. The mod team has been tired of the deficit in quality and the general responses of the community. First, I would like to address... if you can't handle criticism or skeptical responses then don't post. I'm tired of people *expecting* praise. If someone doesn't praise your set then don't whine over it. Our mod team is tired of seeing people reported for saying something negative about bad sets or leaving feedback. Secondly, sets that do not meet our standards and are met with generally negative responses or fall below a threshold of -3 karma will be removed by default. These changes will be made from this point onward. To clarify, this does not inherently mean to not post sets that you do not believe are up to par. I highly encourage you to post imperfect sets so people can help give you recommendations. Just don't expect praise to come naturally. Adhere to the following general rules regarding properties of a good set so that more objective ratings and criticisms can be made.\n\n1. A coherent theme that is obvious at first glance yet not something generic. (Though, generic sets can sometimes be good, such as a well thought out Legion or Void set.)\n2. A matching color palette that flows well without clashing is good. Variety in color definitely helps to improve your set but if the palette is simple and looks good then that's fine.\n3. Similar shading styles between different pieces are fairly important. You can't use a practically unshaded item with something that is overshaded.\n4. It has to be a full set. That means armor, weapon, cape, helm, or an appropriate hair helm (Some hairs from hair shops get a pass i.e.: Darkblood horned hairs get a pass but not Bangs2. Also, unarmed does not count towards the weapon slot, nor do most orbs/lightning effects. Orbs/Lightning effects are fine if they make sense in the set but don't use them because you can't think of a weapon.)\n5. Try keeping your use of CC items limited. One piece is fine two is questionable. However, anything more than that is unwarranted. (The whole set can't consist of CC items. It's uninspired and boring.)\n6. No same-set items. There is nothing that shows you didn't make an attempt at creating a set which is more obvious than using two same-set items. I don't care how good they look. They were made to go together.\n7. It's not always required but geometric similarities between items go a long way to make your set look better.\n8. For the love of everyone, please don't post shitty Hollowborn garbage. It is so fucking overused and shows no effort put into meticulously perfecting the set. Besides, I like to actually see the set without having to turn brightness to max then squint to draw out details as my eyes literally get burned and scarred permanently by bright neon green accents.",
