We value your safety and privacy above anything else. To download bots from this subreddit, go over to our portal website: [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/)\n\n**Firstly, you will need to download the Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7 application.** Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jozmg9/download_grimoire_38_pro_v177/) for more info on how to edit or use it. This is an exclusive service offered by our subreddit.\n\nOnce you have that, click Download Boots and search up the boot you want to run on the portal. Click on its name to download it. If you see a boot post on the subreddit, you may download it from there as well. Note that boots posted are approved by the moderators of this subreddit, and hence will guarantee their quality and safety. If you download a boot from a post in this subreddit, you will find virus scans as well. Make sure to upvote any boot that helps you!\n\nIf you're having trouble running a boot or would like to learn how to make edits in order to optimize it, use the [Grim 101 Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9uke1qa0pzjAOTMUkasGR7Rqsz0fdOwdV0BaEzz0/edit) by /u/DragonTaryth. If you need assistance with a boot you downloaded, feel free to make a post on the subreddit, comment on the post you downloaded it from, or message us in one of our chat rooms. If you're posting on the subreddit, it helps a lot to take a screenshot of the part of your bot that isn't working. Just use a snipping tool.",

Moderators will go over your boot and make changes as necessary to optimize it as much as possible, and then upload it on the portal and send you a copy of the boot. When you have this copy, you may make a boot post on the subreddit, describing exactly what your boot does and instructions to run it and the like. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DC4ceYgz8-ltXDKGw8hSPZIzywzwS3Mk4npYvCMiP7c/edit?usp=sharing) to find the boot post format and some other basic tips for boot makers to make your and our lives easier. If you have the permissions to, do make your comments section a live chat so it's easier to ask for any help needed.\n\nDo **NOT** post boot files on the subreddit. Doing so will be considered as a violation of the safety and privacy of our users and will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you post at least 5 good boots (before moderator edits), you can apply for a moderator position. You'll have limited permissions, but will gain more with contributions to our subreddit.",

You can also add the **Questions and Help** flair to allow people to immediately understand that you need help. If you can, make the comments section of your post a live chat so it's easier for us to diagnose and troubleshoot your problem.

            "image": null,
            "text": "**1. Why is my Boot not loading?** \n\nIf your boot isn't loading, this means you're using an outdated version of Grimoire. All new and recently made bots are made specifically for the latest versions of Grimoire, known as Grimoire 3.8+ PRO v1.7.7. You can get the latest version of Grimoire from the Portal Site.\n\n**2. Boot keeps disconnecting?!**\n\nThis means your Boot Delay is very low. Most boots will have a \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command at the very top. You want to replace this with higher bot delay command. To do so, just head over to:\n\n    Misc -> Boot Delay -> (Change the number in the box to 10) -> Select the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command -> Hold Ctrl and Click \"Set Boot Delay\" -> Remove the \"Set Boot Delay: 0\" command.\n\nYou may now edit this command to a higher value such as 20 or 30 (by double clicking and replacing 10 with the desired number) if you're still disconnecting, but don't go too high as that would make the boot slow and inefficient. Some boots have a \"Set Boot Delay: 1\" command and those boots can be edited directly by double clicking.\n\n**3. Boot not working?**\n\nIf a boot isn't working, read the instructions on how to use the boot once again, if they are provided (they may be on the boot post on the subreddit or in the zip file in which you download your boots) before asking for help. Chances are you'll find your answer there. Furthermore, please take the time to read a guide on whatever item you're farming so you'll know exactly what the boot is supposed to be doing. If a boot stops without giving you the item you're farming, chances are it farmed all the required reagents and is waiting for you to turn in the quest yourself.",

You must have Grimoire 3.8+ PRO downloaded in order to run a boot from this subreddit.\n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD GRIMOIRE 3.8+ PRO:**\n\nGrimoire 3.8+ PRO is only supported by Windows. If you are a MacOS user, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPf1yVywKPk&feature=youtu.be).\n\n**To Download Grimoire 3.8+ PRO, you'll need either WinRAR or 7zip.** Once you have those, head over to our portal site, [https://skidson.club/](https://skidson.club/), and click on **\"Download Grimoire\"**, which should automatically download it for you. Once you download it, you'll be able to run any boot you download from the same portal site. Refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoQuestWorlds/comments/jghh66/download_boots/) for further information on how to download and run boots if you're new.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Grimoire 3.8+ PRO Exclusive Features:**\n\n1. **Selecting Multiple Commands:** Simply drag your pointer across various commands\n2. **Copying and Pasting Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+C to copy it and Ctrl+V to paste it below your selected line.\n3. **Duplicating Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+D to duplicate them.\n4. **Quickly Moving Commands:** Select your command(s) and use Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to move them up or down respectively. You can hold Ctrl+Up/Down to move them several lines above or below also.\n5. **Adding Commands to a certain part of the boot:** Tired of adding a command and having it show up at the very bottom of the command list? Just go to the line above which you want to add the command, hold Ctrl, and add the command. For example, if you want to add a Kill \\* command above line 53 of your boot, select line 53, hold Ctrl, and add the Kill \\* command. It will show up in your desired position. (Actually a 3.8+ feature but very worth mentioning.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Advanced Commands (ignore if you're just a casual user):**\n\n**Index Commands:** Most lines in your command list in Grimoire 3.8+ PRO will have numbers next to them indicating which line it is, known as their index. You can add a command that makes the boot go to a specific index; or a command that goes a few Indexes up or down. You'll find Index commands in the Misc tab.\n\n**Integer Commands:** You can use a command to assign an integer value to a variable if you want the boot to remember information. Integer values can also be increased or decreased using commands. For example, if you want the boot to remember if the player is a member or not, you can make the boot go to a member only map like /nulgath, wait a few seconds, and set some variable (say, m) value as 1. Later on, if you want the boot to do something specific based on whether or not you're a member, you can add If Statement saying something along the lines of:\n\n    m == 1\n    Goto label: MEMBER\n\nInteger commands can be found in the Misc tab as well, and their If Statements can be found by going to the If Statement section and selecting Misc on the first line. You'll see Int is / Int is not / Int is greater than / Int is less than. There's a lot of stuff you can pull off with Indexes and Integers if used correctly.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut wait, that's not all!

I've noticed one difference between the two, and it's that Cetera, old as it is, is one compact .exe file, rather than one entire folder with the client and other stuff like Grimoire/Grimlite (as I said, I tried running them so I kinda remember that), and with that being said, maybe Cetera works for me because it's one file with all the content to be run, and maybe Grimoire/Grimlite won't work because the client file needs all the other files to be present in order to run but somehow Mac can't do that, starting with the fact that's an .exe file we're talking about and that a media player can only run one file at a time in one session and won't access multiple ones like you'd expect. Basically my suggestion here is **tryna turn the entire Grimoire/Grimlite folder into one .exe file with everything inside**, if that's possible though. And I think that's the easier one of the two because my next suggestion is\n\n2. **Directly trying to make Grimoire/Grimlite compatible with Mac, maybe as a .dmg or something**. It would be really nice but I really don't know how this would work, since to my understanding Apple in general has always been really like \"official\", and maybe there'd be licence stuff going on and such, however if this turned out ok it'd be the best out of the two.\n\nI'm talking on behalf of all Mac users who been tryna bot but can't due to all bots being mostly .exes, yeah we exist, sorry.\n",

Being active rewards you with special roles (for example if you are level 90, you are a **Seraphim**) which later would qualify you to participate in **exclusive** rewards\n3. Recommended items channel where you can post your favorite items that other players can use universally\n4. Suggestions channel  for overall server recommendations & improvements\n5. Memes channel because OF COURSE, YOU NEED ONE (moderate memes please nothing too dank)\n6. **\"Dress to Impress\"** is the ULTIMATE destination for posting any sets and getting recommendations\n7. Every day/night we feature special sets in the \"style-icons\" channel as well as special houses in the \"house-design-icons\" channel\n8. Art & OC showcase for showing us your own art or art that was drawn by someone else for you as a commission for example\n9. Constant updates/improvements & mods that listen to your recommendations and concerns\n10. Server members' house where you can hang out or afk instead of Yulgar XD\n\n*How to join?*\n\nWith over 168 members and growing, we would love to have you just **copy & paste** the link:  \n\n[discord.gg/AeqmHnKt2e](https://discord.gg/AeqmHnKt2e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AQWF logo](https://preview.redd.it/7mxjber0zbl71.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=9210746317d96dde2ea401172912c3932ca426b9)\n",

Recently I've been trying for the Armor of Awe for the new questline and while grinding for it I've wondering why in fact there are so many server when most of them barely have over 100 players. When I log in and see that Artix is full I have to constantly wait to refresh or pray people on Yorumi are doing the grinds. So my proposal would be to combine some servers to create 3 \"mega-servers\". We could have an Artix server with a max amount of 5000 players (which is probably not going to be maxed out LOL), a Twilly server (for canned chat), and a Sir Ver (just because). Maybe a Espada server bc that decently populated too. What do you guys think?\n",

I have had the Dark Brotherhood guild name since the moment guilds released just never actively recruited. So here we are! I am looking for active players as I log on daily. The main goal is helping each other farm or catch up on story content. I am lv 83 with VHL, LR, LC, and Chaos Prime. I am well equipped to assist with pretty much everything. Right now I only have the base 15 slots open but if we get a large influx of people who want to join I will gladly buy more slots. I am on EST and only speak English. You are free to join regardless of your time zone or primary language just know that I might not be free to help or understand you if you are put of my time zone or don\u2019t primarily speak English. I play on Artix and Ser Ver mainly. I have a discord for the guild that I am setting up. Hope to hear from you!\n",

All the other areas on the map are completed.\n\nRelogging, defeating the mini-bosses again or rewatching the cutscenes does nothing, I just get taken back to the /palooza starting screen. I've scoured the wiki for solutions and bug reports.\n\nIs there anything I can do to circumvent this (eg reset questline progress) or is an issue that can only be fixed directly by AQW staff?

There was only 1 post on this \\~2 years ago and I would like to know your more updated opinion on this for 2021! :D\n\nIf anyone has had any similar thoughts please detail them below, in order, oh and please don't forget your reason on why! Thank you!\n\nLore-wise, My Top 5 would be:\n\n1. Dragon of Time - This class is basically us achieving our full potential.\n2. Eternal/Immortal Chronomancer - According to its description, your character transcends time & space and be in all dimensions an infinities at once.\n3. Eternal Inversionist - If I remember correctly, I believe this class can manipulate Space, Time, and Dimensions up to the 4th dimension.\n4. Infinity Titan - Doesn't this class basically let us manipulate Time, Space, **Reality**, Souls, Minds, and Something similar to Power?\n5. Chaos Champion Prime - You're basically Drakath at his most powerful.\n",

Me and my girlfriend are trying to get back into the game, what should we know? What is there to even do? I see a lot of posts about \"botting\", what is that? and is that the norm? \n\nAlso, can anyone take a look at my character page and let me know if my classes are fine for today? I feel like mine are outdated and replaced by better ones. For example, I saw a post earlier that said Necro isn't a good solo class anymore, compared to some of the newer classes. That came as a shock to me, since I remember thinking it was OP lol. \n\nFinally, it is one of my goals to get Seppy's armor and helm, as he was always my favorite character. Is the grind for it tremendously long?\n",

I want to get my Cape of Awe, and I'm at the point I need to kill Binky, but at level 32, I dont think there's any class I can do it with. I tried going to battleon a few times but noone replied. Any advice?  \n\n\nI tried searching youtube for solo methods, but with 900K HP, and all the strategies being outdated it seems im at a hard wall basically.  \n\n\nThanks\n",

I usually build it up to like 5 max stacks and then heal. But here's the tricky part, it heals from 500+, 1000+, or 4000+ hp, which makes farming high level mobs difficult and me dying. So, is it random, from my stacks or a bug? ](https://preview.redd.it/0mrkusnvstx61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f711dcc3ea089030d6b36657f309a17c02ecd19)\n",

Then I started my rep grinds, since we're on a 72 hour rep boost. So far I've maxed out: Good, Chaos, ChronoSpan, and Yokai to rank 10. I also used an upgrade bonus on Infinity Titan, so I don't need SC. My current goal is to complete ArchPaladin, and I'm at the Chaos Alteon bit, so I'm getting Horc Evader because noobs keep attacking during his Chaos Charge purple bar thingie. if theres a different easier class to solo Chaos Alteon, let me know. I also have level 10 LightMage in my bank, but I'm only character level 77 so I cant start the LightCaster chain quite yet.  \n\n\nI also plan on doing Arcangrove (R1), Embersea (R5), and Swordhaven (R7) next.  \n\n\nWhat other reputations are worth doing while the boost is active?\n",

            "image": null,
            "text": "Now, not to hate on anyone writing the \"newest\" Queen of Monsters saga, but I really don't think we need to do this again. It's been a few years and I'll explain why this isn't necessary at this time and maybe what they could be doing with this whole month. Even though it won't change anything, this announcement which would've excited me 2 years ago now just increases the suffering I feel by sticking with this game. Here we go, with a summary down below. **Spoilers I guess, but who cares at this point?**  \n\n\n  \nThe **Queen of Monsters** was set up to be the big bad antagonist after we dispatched Drakath at the Chaos Finale. She was an ancient being who was rooted in Lore before the reset and persisted as the Mother of Chaos, granting Drakath control over chaos, which led to that entire plotline. The key word was, well, was. In 2019, in favour of a shadowidiot who doesn't know how to read the wiki, they decided to \"\"\"temporarily\"\"\" dispatch the Queen of Monsters by showing her severed head to us and having shadowidiot tell us that we're responsible, even though we've never met her face to face once. In 4 years. Not once. Amazing. This shocked me because I really didn't think they could mess up a character this badly, and if they could, they would at least give a reason as to why they decided to kill her through Design Notes or some other means of storytelling but no. Why would I even expect anything?   \n\n\nWe got **shadowidiot** for coming up on 2 years now, and one of AQW's issues is its seasonal season basically throwing out the main story for nearly half of the year, not allowing it to progress because of the bunched holidays and AC packages they have to sell. This led to the Summer of 2019 focusing about gathering guys to fight shadowidiot, then proceeding to not see those guys for a while due to the break, and here we are, going up on the summer of 2021 and we haven't had use for 2 of those allies since. Mainly because they decided that fighting random generals and having shadowidiot not have a simple goal would be a good idea for an antagonist who embodies edge. Starts with leylines, dabbles in ancient relics and Macguffins, maybe a little bit of amulet here, some amulet there, amulet everywhere. It's messy. But at least it's linear. They JUST RECENTLY decided that it would be nice to let people track the story so they put it in the story tab after who knows how long, and it's got a ton of shadowidiot related adventures that tend to only have cameos of him in the releases themselves. Seem similar?  \n\n\nThe **issue** with attempting to revive the queen saga is that, whether you like it or not, you already killed it. More than once. The setup post chaos finale was scrapped, so /summon doesn't matter anymore. When people complained about the carbon copy generals of the queen stuff, you changed it to something else, something ACTUALLY GOOD, exploring the origins of the monsters she had created and why she's called what she is. But then, out of nowhere, for a rushed finale that can barely be considered an end to her reign as a villain, you decided to shove her out of the spotlight for a shadow who can't even stand in it. \n\nIt's not like the trope of a villain being temporarily dispatched, only to be revealed to be alive later isn't useful, heck it's used in a lot of places and is effective occasionally. But the issue is that when you make it seem as if she's dead, give no mention to her besides this weird excuse regarding her death, and don't mention her or any of the things she's done that have drastically changed lore, her just showing up in the middle of ANOTHER antagonist's spotlight, one that has barely expanded since showing up on the scene 2 years ago unexpectedly almost makes it seem as if she wasn't a complete character and didn't have a proper end. Huh. Funny how that works.   \n\n\nMy **point** is this, and these tend to not have a point. Instead of, I don't know, working with old material that was clearly discarded years ago and doesn't actually develop the world you're working in cause haha worldbuilding, why not, I know, focus on the antagonist who we know basically nothing about and attempt to flesh out the new characters you tried to introduce in 6 different releases? I get that the Queen is supposed to be some pivotal part of Lore, but the failure and lack of overall direction in her saga heavily hinders her ability to be, well, important to anyone that isn't me.   \n\n\nIt's funny how I wouldn't be saying this if this release came, I don't know, **AFTER** the Book of Monsters when you tried to do this the first time and succeeded. The Rift is an AMAZING zone that is located IN a previously established area that has existed since the start of the game. It has some new, some old characters and even some Easter eggs thrown in, while managing to keep the tone desperate and depressing. Instead of slotting it in now, after the not great not really a finale finale of her saga, it would have been much more beneficial if the Book of Monsters continued. Heck, the **BOOK OF MONSTERS** is in your release!   \n\n\n**But I digress. A simple summary of what I've just said is:**\n\n\\-**The Queen was fine as an antagonist after the reboot and was set up well from the beginning of the game**  \n\\-**The inability to close out the saga or actually have a plan for it heavily hindered it up until its finale, or whatever that was supposed to be**  \n\\-**Malgor is dumb, stupid and dumb, and also suffers from a lack of character, because they forgot to give him that too**  \n\\-**Even if I don't like shadowidiot, you should stick to him because you started this mess, and someone has to clean this up before it gets out of hand**  \n\n\n**I guess Malgor and the Queen share something in common, being brainless. Basically, all this jumping around doesn't get you somewhere if it's not at the right time. After all, that's one of the reasons this game dropped so hard after Chaos Finale, isn't it?**\n",

I still have permanent membership in AQ and DF, but I never really played much of AQW at all, and know very little about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow much am I missing out on by not having membership in this game? And how much, if any, of that content can I get without paying money? I've set a personal limit for myself to only ever pay for ONE MMO, and I'm definitely not unsubbing from FFXIV to sub to this game. I'm hopeful that I can at least get a fairly good experience with this game for free, but considering the dragon amulet and the guardianship for the two aforementioned other games, I'm a little worried about missing out on most of the fun.\n",

            "text": "Most of you will know how it works, **specific race damage boost** or **multiple races damage boost** ***stack*** with **damage boost to all monsters**, so NSoD, Awescended Omni Blades, BBoA or such **will stack** with other sources like SDKA, Polly Roger (since is **damage to all tagged monsters**, not damage to all monsters) or Head of the Legion Beast (40% more damage to Humans/Undeads and 30% more damage to Dragons).\n\nI'm ok with this bit, it's fine if they don't stack, however, something that many people may not realize is that **equipping** an item with **lower boosts** ***after*** will overwrite the higher ones, so equipping NSoD first and equipping AFDL after, **will decrease your damage** vs all monsters from 51% to 35%, since the latest one equipped is the one used. This also affects if you are using specific damage boosts, for example, Blinding Light of Destiny has a 75% extra damage vs Undeads, so **equipping** something with **a lower boost** to that race after (even if it grants damage boosts against multiple races, like what happens with Polly Roger), it **will decrease your damage boost**.\n\nAE already stated multiple times that this is **not a bug**, however, it's still incredibly annoying, since it forces you to **re-equip your whole set**, which paired with enhancements makes the game way less interactive, and goes against the idea of being able to change your outfit at any given time. That's why I really think they should change it **so the highest damage boost is always applied**, even if they still doesn't stack, or at least a \"Boost checker\" that makes you able to check which boosts are active at any time.\n\nI'd love to see other's opinion about this topic, and hopefully AE changes something to make it less awkward than what it is now.\n",

            "text": "So on Monday I noticed when playing AQWorlds that my XP was giving me the regular XP from killing enemies but the bonus instead of the 25% from my Cape of Awe it was giving me like 150%, say the level 69 Icy Wind at icestormarena which is 724 + 25% for the cape would show like +2500 (XP Boost enabled too) but then the next day would be normal rates. It's happened twice, like one 2 separate days. This affected all enemies.\n\nWhat is causing this? Bug? Server XP rate increase?\n\nI'm confused as I've just gotten back in to AQW after not really playing at all since 2014. But I personally like having this high xp rate as the game got super grindy after they made 65 the level cap. I remember always hitting it before it was raised until level 55/65 I got to 49 and then stopped\n",

I got very mixed vibes from the comments. There are people strongly against botting, and people who think botting is essential to enjoy the game properly.\n\nA game's sole purpose is to bring joy. If a loyal player of a game craves some external program or bot to bring the appropriate amount of joy for the game to be playable, something is not right. \n\nMany non-botters brought forth the argument that AQW is about the satisfaction of working for an item. That's is undoubtedly true. AQW has always been about getting rewarded for your hard work. I remember the day I FINALLY got rank 10 chaos with my Mage class after days of farming on my old laptop. I will never forget that feeling, because it encapsulates this game so well.\n\nHowever, the farmable items have grown more difficult and ridiculous to obtain with time. Their power has also considerably spiked. A lot of people in the comments also mentioned that the Void Highlord and Legion Revenant grinds are NOT mandatory. But, what's the point of playing AQW and not getting the most EPIC items? Who doesn't want Void Highlord or another cool OP class?\n\n\"Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody wants to lift heavy ass weights\" - Ronnie Coleman. This is where the problem starts. Every wants the items. but nobody wants to \"lift heavy ass weights\" because the weight lifting is just too boring and not worth it.\n\nDo you remember the Leprechaun event classes? What a joy it was to farm for them! You actually were having fun whilst playing AQW. They had all these cool minigames and you needed to stay focused and do your best if you wanted the maximum amount of rewards. Now, a lot of the farming seems dull and very repetitive, almost as if it was *made* for a machine. I mean, who wants to click skeletons until you have 40 thousand bone dust, so you can merge them into Tainted Gems, just for you to realize that you're not even 20 % done with the farming process? Easier to let a bot do the monotone work and have fun with events and other content.\n\nI get that AQW is not their main focus right now, but it should be! AQW is the game that made them famous and it is the most iconic of them all.\n\nWhat do you think? Is change necessary?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Many people are botting because of different reasons. AQW is about the satisfaction of getting an item, but the items are harder and harder to get. So people bot instead of doing repetitive tasks because they're boring. Is change necessary?\n",

Please no.\n\nIt honestly bothered me how Legion Revenant wasn't like this, when ArchPaladin came out before it, and seeing how great the grind was it frustrates me why the LR grind was so different. 1 was hands-on,you need to actually participate in the game to play, and you need other players to kill a boss. The other 1 requires you to get a decent class and kill mosnters again and again repetitively.\n\nThe principle is the same(killing monsters repetitively) but because you let the players become engaged at the game, it suddenly becomes more fun.\n",

In this post, I will share to you on the best way to use them, so none of them will go to waste. \n\nBTW, be sure to check on your Account Page so you can get yourself a Bonus Package (if you bought an AC/Membership Package). You have a wide variety of options, all of which contain gear such as armors and weapons, sometimes even houses. It's all up to you on which would you choose. In my opinion, however, the package with the most value is Infinity Titan. It includes weapons, armors, helms, capes, pets, a house and a class variant. The class variant it has is a reskin of Stonecrusher, which is arguably the best support class in the game. It's effects also stack with a Stonecrusher if one is present in a room you're in. \n\nBefore spending your AC's you should do the following first: \n\n\u2022 Get Rank 10 in Doomwood and Embersea rep. You can search for guides on YouTube on how to increase your rep fast.\n\u2022 Pre-farm 200 Combat Trophies. Do this in a private room so you can do it faster.\n\u2022 Complete the following quest lines:\n       \u2022 Black Knight in /greenguardweat\n       \u2022 Snowbeard & Donna Charmer's quests in /tavern and /llama\n       \u2022 Do all quests in /willowcreek until you are able to see a Dwakel Soldier. \n\nAfter you've done all that, follow this in order: \n\n1. Buy Pyromancer from the Class Shop in the Game Menu for 2,000 AC's. Once you have at least 1 class point for the class, go to /fireforge and look for an NPC named High Adept Caustus and open the AC Pyromancer Sigil shop. Since you have Rank 10 rep for Doomwood and Embersea you will be able to get a Darkness Sigil and Flame Sigil. You can merge that for the Blaze Binder class, one of the best farming classes in the game. After getting the class, sell your Pyromancer to get 1,800 AC's back. Make sure to do this in less than 24 hours so you can maximize the sellback value of the class. \n\nEven though you can do this, I would rather recommend you to just do the dailies to merge for Pyromancer. \n\n2. Go to /underworld and look for Dage the Evil. Open his armor shop and buy Undead Warrior for 1,200 AC's. Once you do, complete Dage's quests from \"Undead Champion Initiation\" until \"Fail to the King.\" After that, sell back Undead Warrior for 1,080 AC's. Again, make sure to do this in less than 24 hours so you can maximize the sellback value of the armor. \n\nOnce you complete this you will be a member of the Legion. With this you will have more access to classes like Legion DoomKnight, Yami no Ronin, and Legion Revenant, and more awesome gear, especially in March during Dage's birthday. \n\n3. Get yourself a LightMage class that can be upgraded into Lightcaster, one of the best solo and support classes in the game, once you reach level 80. To do this go to /celestialrealm, talk to Aranx and buy an Evolved Lightcaster armor for 1,000 AC's then buy the LightMage class. It is a pretty good class as well if you don't have Lightcaster yet.\n\nNotes:\n\u2022 Make sure to do the first and second part in less than 24 hours. If you follow this guide properly, you could get up to 880 AC's, depending on if you do the AC method of Blaze Binder.\n\u2022 I do not recommend you to buy classes for 2,000 AC's because all of them are farmable and are not worth the value. Seasonal or rare classes, however, are okay if you choose the right one. I recommend getting Timeless/Immortal Dark Caster class during March or Abyssal Angel's Shadow during November.\n\u2022 I don't recommend spending AC's on Fortune Tickets and/or Treasure Chest keys because they are based on RNG. If you want to do it, go for it I guess.\n\nHere are other suggestions on AC items that I believe are worth the money:\n\u2022 Nulgath Birthday Gift (seasonal) is arguably the best Nulgath regeant farming pet especially if you plan on farming for Void Highlord and Enchanted Nulgath Nation House.\n\u2022 If you have cash to burn and have 6,000 AC's you can get calendar classes in /curio as they are the best soloing classes in the game. I recommend\u00a0 Shadowstalker of Time because it is well-rounded.\n\u2022 Bank pets cost 2,000 AC's and are made for convenience. If you have one you can just click on it and access your bank. Then again, you could just get a Bonus Package that has bank capes.\n\u2022 You can also get seasonal and event rares if you're into that stuff. \n\nThat's pretty much it. You can spend your AC's however you want. These are just recommendations on how you can make the most out of it. If you have other ideas or corrections, feel free to share them in the replies. Have fun and Battle On!\n",

Of course he was talking about the server write and that he had the ideas of the server rewrite. \n\n\nHowever jesus crucified on a cross before he could share his ideas. \"Forgive them father for they don't know what they do\" of course he was talking about delaying the server rewrite.  and the server rewrite never came. This is why we have been waiting millenials for the second of jesus.\n",

            "text": "  \n**Spoilers for this week's release and whatever Queen related stuff you didn't know. But once again, who cares....**\n\n  \nAfter playing the most recent release in the \"Queen of Monsters\" saga, I thought it was going to be over. I thought I could move on from this character and acknowledge that although the saga had potential, it failed in execution through a series of changes and unfortunate timing. But I can't even do that.  \n\n\nI'll just state the problems since I can see those more clearly than the good parts of the release.  \n\n\n**Anka. Yes, Anka.** It's really hard to care. Like it actually takes a fair amount of effort to care. She's like, supposed to be more than the quest giver, but she doesn't really develop at all? I can barely call her a character, and I'm not sure if the intention was for her to be one, because I don't feel anything when she's dead. Heck, good riddance. She showed up for this saga, was the driving force for this saga, and died in this saga. Laguna, the MERDRACONIAN FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO, did this better, because the whole accept power, corrupted by power you can't control thing, although a recycled formula and basically the basis of shadowflame and all that, was newer in the chaos style. This feels like the exact same sort of thing, but I care less about the random human who wanted knowledge than the random merdraconian with a ship. Funny. I would go on about her being the antagonist but honestly? The antagonist of this story was me, trying to find a reason to play it.  \n\n\n**The Twins**. Do I even have to say much about this? While they weren't fully fleshed out characters before, they got a little better with duality plane (and a little worse in some ways) and really haven't had the chance to be important besides Xing's scuffle in the mirror realm. That sorta didn't really do anything. But I have the pleasure of saying that this release, they actually manage to make worse. The cutscenes with Drakath are filler, and instead of going towards all this info that Anka is saying, it goes to the Twins playing around with Drakath on their new cellphone. Those could have just been skipped if you just added Drakath going down the tunnel at the end of last release. Worst of all, they take away screen time from us, the protagonist, and Anka, the soon to be antagonist. **BUT THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING.** They don't help us fight, they don't report correctly to Drakath and they don't serve a purpose to the actual narrative. Comic relief can exist but it's a lot easier if you have it tied into characters who actually, I dunno, do something other than be funny-not-funny. Sorry, but they're just a shell of their former, chaos saga selves. It's one of the reasons why I question even bringing them back in the first place.  \n\n\n**The info**. The singular thing I thought this release was going to do was actually shed some light on the Queen and it did. It told us about her origins and how she came to be, and although it seems a little too out of the blue that she just happened to live without a heart for a few months and create a portal to another realm, a new plane of existence, I can overlook it because it's unique in its nature. A little convenient yes, but I've seen crazier and more spontaneous. But like Drakath said all this time, if she's dead why bother. And that was a question that I constantly have to think about. The hero doesn't justify their decision here, or stress why it's so important we learn about it. It just happens and we get roped into this mess. And what do you know, at the end of the release we have this magical plot device that can tell us what we need to know, and what do they do?  \n\n\nNot use a flashback cutscene? Wait what? Hold on. You're telling me, we used the somehow all powerful knowing device to confirm what Malgor told us about 2 years ago, but we still don't know what actually happened? And there's TIME SHENANIGANS INVOLVED? Why did we even bother, we have actually only learned info that while nice to know, doesn't help us in the future because the queen is dead. Or she should be. Who knows at this point. Hurts my brain to think about.  \n\n\n**The End.....?**  \n\n\nIt's funny how I played this and thought that I actually might have preferred a month of Malgor updates over this. Mainly because even though they will focus on him later in June, this just didn't feel like a story I wanted to play. Not because the hero was shoehorned into it due to plot. Not even cause the characters were definitely lacking. Mainly just because the majority of the release just felt like fetching simulator with Anka to get into this tunnel that was never mentioned and is just here now in a location that Drakath just so happened to build his castle on and doesn't have any prior significance to chaos like Thunderforge did and required a book that Drakath just so happened to have stumbled upon and secured that happens to know the way to this tunnel that Anka somehow just knows about.  \n\n\n  \n**The End (Summary)**  \n\n\nThe release does things amazingly. We're back to auto completes being standard, amazing map and monster designs and music quality is sounding okay in most of the maps. Most. But the actual story and content of the release. Can't believe I'm saying this but you might enjoy it more if you just skipped the cutscenes.   \n\n\nIn conclusion, if the Queen of Monsters isn't dead after this release, I'll make a post about everything that's wrong with the entire saga from start to finish. Including whatever bits were thrown in between. And I don't think I'll enjoy making it. \n\nIf it's too long to read, don't bother. It's just my opinion and who knows, maybe you liked the saga. But  there's problems and I'm not hesitant to point them out.\n",

I got 2 items from the awesomeness stuff, legion revenant and Necro (I know many of you are gonna be like why buy two farmable items wtf?!)\n\nSimply put, the grind for them is just tedious, I've played games like BDO/Runescape, grind doesn't bother me. The grind is this game makes it so anything like revenant you're gonna be spending hours in one day just getting one thing.\n\nFor example to put it into context, you need 20 spellscrolls for legion fealty for. You have to do the first quest 20 times for one item.\n\nNow, why do I say it's not worth it? Simply put, regret. It's really not worth it, you may want the items like I did, but in the end take my advice, don't do it.\n\nHope this persuades someone else from making this mistake :\\]\n",

Might actually be B tier at soloing. Your solo DPS seems to be very reliant on whether or not your last skill crits. I didn't really test out farming too much, but it seems to have pretty good sustain and damage (maybe A tier farmer, on par with Dark Lord).\n\n    As much as I don't like classes that play around with your health, it's kind of a fun mechanic how you have to play around with Psion Drain and Cerebral Siphon to balance your HP and mana (skills are not spammable). Overall decent class, just feels kinda weird to use.\n",

Say what you want about AQW's mechanics but its vibrant art style brought a lot of unique artists and characters together under a single game.\n\n\n\nFFXIV... close, but gameplay requires a lot of grinding and performance isn't good on laptops or shitty rigs.\n\n\n\nI played AQW since Beta and met so many good friends through it but it's been over a decade. We had a \"clan\" and forum with over 1000 people but like most online community's it's long gone over time. Wish there was another simple game that could foster this vibe... With mobile games and Steam it seems like there really should be something.\n",

Are there cool new stories I should play through (deliberately avoided wiki for potential spoilers).\n\nAlso am I right in understanding that rares aren't really rares anymore? I've seen so many things about IODA, if I'm reading right does this mean anyone can get items like Beta-zerker or 1st upholder starsword etc?

Surely a 2D flash game from 2009 can\u2019t be more CPU taxing than Destiny 2 or Black Desert.\n\nIs this a common issue?\nI\u2019m using the Artix Launcher version of the game (I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another version) and I\u2019m running an R7 3750H CPU\n",

If the difference is negligible I'll probably get LR either way but I'm just not sure.\n\nWhat are your guys' thoughts?

I go to Ice Storm Arena to level up, use some boosts and I can stay there for some minutes but then I get disconnected. The problem is that my class resets the rank to 1 but my boosts do not. That sounds stupid right? and the second one is that when I was farming a boss for a kinda rare item to get ArchPaladin, when I dropped the item, I couldnt accept the item but I could click on \"No\" to not accept it. I had to relogin, get the item again to accept it. I have passed throught a lot of bugs in that game and I cant find a solution for it. I\\`m not asking for a solution coz probably theres not. I just want to let off steam.\n",

I also liked that they're making use of the Elemental Planes once again. The movements of the characters in the cutscenes are nice too.\n\nI kind of think that the Hero and Malgor really have a connection of some sort. My theory is Malgor might be the Hero (us) from a future where the Queen has succeeded. Time travel is stupid, but the Hero did it multiple times already, and not to mention that the Hero is the Dragon of Time. In Doomwood Saga 3, Stellaria mentioned that it all started to happen when the Hero regained his/her powers back and that Artix dies from the Hero (final cutscene). Also in Doomwood Saga 1, Vordred planned to kill Artix to become the Champion of Darkness himself, but failed at it of course. So as to where the Shadowflame came from, I think when the Artix died the Hero gained the title of being the Champion of Darkness. About the techno undead thing of Doomwood 3, the only thing I could think about it is the virus that was hidden in /shadowvault and the Hero might have unleashed it, in turn getting infected by it as well. But since the Hero is also something else, those \"powers\" were merged and corrupted into a new form power, the Shadowflame. In Doomwood 3, it was never mentioned that the Hero was dead, just gone. Travelling back in time would explain that disappearance.  \n\n\nSorry about the post, it may kind of sound stupid, but I really needed to let them out of my head since I don't have anyone I can share em with.\n",

There is support for screenshot key (also for char pages), keybindings for usefull pages like the Wiki, design notes, account settings and char pages, and even support for playing in multiple windows, for alt accounts, or opening the original game (the non-aqlite, pure version) in another window. \n\nOur original goal was to bring Aqlite for linux, as browser support died, but we achieved so much more... We can now bring AQLite to Linux, the 32 bit variations of windows and linux, and even ARM! As we dont have a Mac for compiling, we cant provide a mac download, but **if you desire a mac version, we show how to compile one for yourself!** so dont give your hopes up!\n\nWe recently achieved version 1.0, and its all open sourced in github. Any problems or suggestions, just open an Issue there or send a message to me or u/askelam. We hope to save someone from having to go back to windows for aqlite or from staying in the artix game launcher (no aqlite) in their native platform.  \n\n\n**TL.DR -** Aquastar tries to bring AQLite and more QoL outside of the game to windows and other platforms. Links to download bellow.\n\n[Aquastar Download page](https://github.com/aquaspy/AquaStar/releases), exe files for windows, appimages for linux. Exe is an installer, so it can show up in windows menu later and AppImages are a local executable, just run it. Also, i386 versions are the same as 32 bits, if needed.\n",

We are AQW focused however we are slowly expanding into other games we share our passion of gaming in.

All we ask for is that you are active whether that is in-game or in our discord.

However, we do have players from all over the world. Be friendly. Be nice to each other and no trash talking is allowed. \n\n**How to join:**\n\nTo join in on the fun with us, join our discord server in which you will be welcomed by our officers who can invite you into the guild in-game.\n\n**Info:**\n\nGuild Name: Voices of the Extinct & Echoes of the Lost (Our branch guild)\n\nMy IGN: Kuros, I will be at Yorumi Yulgar-1024 when online \n\nDiscord link for those interested - [https://discord.gg/ZBAkkp7xnb](https://discord.gg/ZBAkkp7xnb)\n\nOur discord server is active and is ready to help any new players who decide to join us, we have dedicated players with the Helper role who you can ping at any time :)\n",

It's been explicitly stated that Captain Rhubarb managed to fix a couple of things, in regards to the \"Detsterrat Moya\" fix in relation to the big octopus-faced \"God of the Dead\".  \nSo, I kinda wanna talk about this: What in the world is going on with the developers? Honestly, is this some form of sadism that they're trying to integrate into the game?  \nTake for example Undead Raxgore from the Doom Vault B. He now has, apart from his skill locking and tons of HP gimmick the \"Counter\" ability, which can seemingly one-shot those who do not pay much attention when it comes! Now we have two Raxgore's with the \"Counter\", one with the temporary one that has quite the small window of opportunity, wherein you can only attack for a total of 9 seconds before Raxgore engages the \"Counter\" again. This discourages players from ever getting the Helm of Awe and if they do not time it correctly, it'll become quite frustrating! We are talking here about a boss who has nearly 1 million HP in tow and you decide to give him something like this? Come on, you guys, you can be better than this!  \nMy next gripe happens to be with Ultra Vordred from /join epicvordred. He now possesses the ability to transform any HoT into DoT, as well as stun with \"Shadow Grasp\". Who has even asked for something like this, to make these bosses all the more challenging ON TOP OF THEIR LUDICROUSLY LOW DROP RATES. Need I say more? These need to be removed, because it's practically displeasing and discouraging to the player base who are striving to obtain one of the Awe Items!   \nThis game is supposed to be enjoyed and to make farming more pleasing. Is this really necessary?\n",

There's way less incentive for me to buy and use AC's because I just won't ever use most of them to buy new sets since I already have a set that goes with my weapons, I just buy them if they're labelled rare and look cool enough.\n\nI doubt there would be some huge surge in popularity, a resurrection of AQW's playerbase, but I believe a lot more people would play semi-actively (At least weekly to check out any new shops or events) if they could actually get excited about new sets. Maybe I'm in the minority who are either too focused on min-maxing with NSoD, or just having it at all, but I'd personally love to be able to use my good weapons but not be locked into a specific colour scheme.\n\nAt the very least, unless it's a huge pain, just add it for the people who WOULD use it rather than not doing anything because most already do just swap through weapons.\n",

            "text": "**Note: Before you decide to call me a weak sob sister and tell me quit my whining: I have in fact beaten all three bosses for this release.**\n\nAQW just released three new \"challenge\" bosses designed to promote combat interactivity. Sounds like a fun idea right?  \n\nArr Ohh Enn Gee: RONG!! \n\nThese guys are the most abhorrent dogshit ever put together in gaming history. I could beat the Orphan of Kos blindfolded with a broken arm, I could beat Sword Saint Isshin in my sleep. But these Exaltia bosses? Let's go over what exactly they are, going from least cancer to most cancer. \n\nThe *last* boss, the Engineer, is actually the easiest. You just need to kill the two drones that accompany it fast enough that the defense one doesn't use its counter attack to wipe out your party, then beat the ever loving shit out of the Engineer itself. A little tricky if you don't have the right classes but can be done quite consistently when you get the hang of it. The Warden is a little more finnicky, what with its powerful shockwaves that heal it as it passes certain health increments. These shockwave attacks aren't too bad even though they hit hard, but the real killer is its petrify, which, if it petrifies your only healer in your party, you're fucked. \n\nBut the first boss, the one you're expected to beat before you fight the Engineer. Ezrajal. Jesus Christ. I've never fought anything so beyond bullshit in my lifetime. I'd rather have tried to solo Yagak in Outriders on the last expedition. I'd rather fight Weiss the Immaculate with no materia. To start off, which I didn't mention before, *all* rooms for these Ultra bosses are limited to 4 players. That's right, 4 players. Not 6, which is the average for most maps that have bosses that have over a million HP. And guess what, all three of these Ultra bosses *each* have 2.5 million HP. That's almost twice the amount of a buffed Immortal Chronomancer nuke. \n\nOf all three Ultra bosses, Ezrajal has the worst mechanics ever conceived in the history of AQW. The first one is his counterattack. Oh that's not so bad, you might say. All you need to do is to stop attacking him right? Well, sure I guess I could go along with that. It's just a shitty way to implement an invulnerability phase to draw out a battle and promote \"interactivity,\" and punish you if you don't pay attention to it. Plus, you have no way to end this invulnerable phase early. The second mechanic is his skill lock. The skill lock is, by and large, probably most punishing, unfun mechanic in the entire game. There's a reason why so many people hated Doom Eternal's second DLC, wherein the Cursed Prowler, once it hit you, actually removed your ability to sprint and dodge. Fun fact: once that happened, you had to chase it down through hordes of enemies and it could *only* be killed with a certain skill that hopefully you had charged up beforehand. But at least you can actually *kill* the Cursed Prowler and end the lockdown early; here with Ezrajal you're just helpless till he decides to release your locked skill. \n\nWhich brings us to his last mechanic. His *nukes* are the equivalent of miniature nuclear weapons. They are *unavoidable* and most appallingly, ***non-reducible***. That's right, you cannot mitigate his nuclear blasts in any way. Yami no Ronin, the king of dodges, cannot dodge it. Shadowscythe General's and Void Highlord's damage reduction are nil. StoneCrusher, Lord of Order, every class that has the ability to reduce damage for the party is useless. Legion Revenant's mana shield does squat. You will be forced to be able to tank not just his nukes, but *every single one of his attacks*, to the face, with zero protection. His nukes aren't so high, you might say. They only hit for, oh, about 2k-3k per shot. Which is, surprise surprise, the entire health bar of 99% of classes in AQW. See where this is going? You cannot dodge any of his attacks, but he can counter every single one of yours, in addition to locking down your skills. You will have to hold off your own attacks while he casually picks off every member of your party like an SS Commandant standing at his balcony picking off the Jew workers in Auschwitz with his Luger. Ezrajal, at his core, is an unfun, cheeky, cancer boss. \n\nBest of all, AQW in its current state is a near dead game, with much of the game and its classes being jack-of-all-trades, DPS beasts that rely on being able to spam all skills mindlessly. You'd be hard-pressed to find more than one player in any of the story zones, and all the popular areas with farmers are almost certainly bots. As a consequence, party-synergy is actually pretty much nonexistent save for buffing DPS. There are almost no true dedicated tanks (no tank in-game can take a single hit from Icewing), no true *healer* healers, all the typical RPG classes, etc. etc. You cannot even overwhelm this boss with numbers, since you're reduced to only 4 players. Guess what? Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft allow dozens of players in raids, and they can *all* still be wiped out by the boss. When an enemy monster can mitigate all your attacks with no way for you to counter it, can kill you with no way for you to counter it, and can lock down your *own ability to play the game* with **no goddamn way for you to counter it**, you've really done it. You basically killed your own game. \n\nTL;DR: Counter attack and skill lock shouldn't even be in this game, and *certainly not* in tandem with unavoidable, non-reducible, giga nukes.\n",

But first I suggest you guys to find eager teammates and try to solve their mechanics. So yeah let's start.  \n\n\nClasses : StoneCrusher, Legion Revenant, Arch Paladin and Lord of Order  \n\n\nWe literally used only these four to defeat them all. They are pretty straightforward and safe options.  \n\n\nUltra Ezrajal : Stop attacking when the counterattack warning appears (Press T). Only use supportive buffing/healing skills to sustain while getting hit. Then check the buff, debuff timer on the near of the boss to see if the stance is changed.  \n\n\nUltra Warden : Just spam I guess...? This was the easiest. (We literally tried it once or twice I don't really remember it)  \n\n\nUltra Engineer : Yeah... This one was quite hard not gonna lie. I was the LoO in the comp so I only focused boss while my mates take care of the drones. My aim here was to maintain my fifth skill's damage reduction stacks. But this alone was not enough we almost always died after the laser. We needed sustain but we were mostly support classes anyways... So we thought throughly and we decided on buying some health potions to use it after boss uses his laser attack. It worked wonderfully. We already had high haste but still we needed a burst healing after boss uses his laser attack. We didn't risk saving our healing skills after the laster attack because we were getting constantly damaged. So health potion in the embersea saved us gracefully.  \n\n\nTell me how did you guys beat them. I wonder what unique tactics you guys used. See ya all!\n",

They are just making complete fake accusations saying they have their game logs to back it up, which is complete lies. I think either they dont want to admit they are wrong or are just powertripping me. \n\nThe reason is a \"severe rules violation\". I made my guild name when I was a teenager and it was pretty stupid, its called \"m i l f t o n i u s\". I didnt think much of it but fast forward to now a staff member found it out and months ago they changed the motd to say something like \"edited the guild name as it violates the rules\". I waited for the guild name to change but a month goes by and nothing, then there is a whole misunderstanding because the the motd changes again says they changed the name to \"AE SUX\", but this was actually a member changing the motd without my permission. I assumed that was AE typing that and I replied with the motd joking about how it hasnt changed yet.\n\nNow that's all out of the way what they have been saying in the replies of the ticket I sent is absolute bullshit. They say they changed the name to \"m i l t o n i u s\" and that I quickly changed it back after. This is bullshit because I didnt even know how to change the guild name, didnt know you could, I was reminded by a friend that there was a free pass we got and I remember I put it in my bank. They even say their game logs backs up their claims but obviously that is lies. I dont know if their game logs are wrong or they are just doing this because they like to. I understand my name goes against the rules but they could have given me a temporary ban or even just bloody asked me to change the guild name, but they didnt. I've been playing since 2008 and spent alot of money on the game, I know they dont want to lose someone like me.\n\nThanks for reading, if you know how to help please tell me.\n\nIf you need anymore proof I can provide.\n",

            "text": "First and foremost, linked attached to the post of the first Redditors/players on this subreddit for defeating the ultra bosses of Exaltia Tower and sharing their experiences!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/ocom4a/lil\\_guide\\_for\\_the\\_tower\\_bosses/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/ocom4a/lil_guide_for_the_tower_bosses/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat will be covered in this guide will elaborate or cover on things not covered in that post (be prepared for spaces):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Ultra Ezrajal\n\nRecommended Classes: Lord of Order, Light Caster, Stone Crusher/Infinity Titan, Archpaladin (or any support class with STRONG heals and damage reduction/damage debuff). One spot can be used for DPS such as Void High Lord strong confidence towards healers and supports.\n\nNote: Dodge classes or classes that reflect damage are completely ineffective.\n\nEnhancement: Powerword Die (can be helpful if you're lucky)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMust know mechanics in order:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. At intervals, the boss will unleash an attack that will heavily damage everyone. Immediately heal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. It is important that everyone is at full health before the periodic attack occurs a mentioned above because if a person is missing even a little bit of health, they will not survive the attack. As such, it is important to be constantly topping off health. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The boss will initiate a counter-attack stance, which you will see a prompt in yellow text saying that the boss is about to counter-attack. It is important that no one attacks the boss. Running away from it improves confidence that no one is attacking the boss during its counter-attack stance. After surviving the counter-attack, DO NOT IMMEDIATELY ATTACK THE BOSS. Let the boss attack you first because if you attack too soon, the counter-attack stance is still active when you would assume otherwise. Immediately heal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltra Warden\n\nRecommended Classes: Lord of Order, Light Caster, Stone Crusher/Infinity Titan, Archpaladin (or any support class with STRONG heals and damage reduction/damage debuff). One spot can be used for DPS such as Void High Lord strong confidence towards healers and supports.\n\nEnhancement: Powerword Die (can be helpful if you're lucky)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMust know mechanics in order:\n\n1. The boss can unleash an attack that will reduce everyone's health to 1 HP, referred as the \"Shockwave\" attack on the Design Notes. Immediately heal. Even if a player is missing health the moment the boss uses the Shockwave attack, it will only reduce the health to 1 HP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The boss can petrify/stun a player, so be ready to immediately heal if one of the healers is petrified/stunned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The boss can somewhat frequently deal large damage that is not the Shockwave attack as mentioned above. Immediately heal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The boss will become enraged when its health drops around 25% HP or less. Immediately kill the boss. Be prepared with supports that reduce cooldown because the boss will increase the frequency of the Shockwave attack. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically repeat steps 1 and 2 during  Ultra Ezrajal fight (but no skills are locked this time). For similar reasons, if a person is missing a little bit of health when the boss does a common attack, they will most likely die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltra Engineer\n\nMandatory Classes: Lord of Order, high DPS class (i.e. Void High Lord), and healing/support classes\n\n(The classes that were present during my experience was: Lord of Order, Void High Lord, Light Caster, and Frostvale Barbarian)\n\nEnhancement: Powerword Die (can be helpful if you're lucky and when the Defense Drone is down)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMust know mechanics in order:\n\n1. There are three monsters total: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, and Ultra Engineer. Before the start of the fight, moving forward from the spot where you enter will cause the Ultra Engineer to target you. It is best for that to not happen. You may move forward to directly attack the Ultra Engineer once the first Attack and Defense drones are destroyed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The general order to attack the three monsters go as follows: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, Ultra Engineer. Even after the drones respawn, attempt to attack in the same order if possible. If the Defense Drone is alive, the Ultra Engineer cannot be damaged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The Defense Drone has a counter-attack similar to  Ultra Ezrajal when its HP is around 25% or lower and a prompt will say in yellow text that the drone will counter-attack, so it is best to burst down the Defense Drone before the prompt appears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The Ultra Engineer periodically unleashes an attack that will instantly kill everyone. The only way to survive this attack (so far) is using Lord of Order's last skill \"Blessing of the Order\". The player using Lord of Order must use said skill the moment the prompt appears that the Ultra Engineer is preparing to attack. IMMEDIATELY HEAL. There is a high chance that if you do not immediately heal after surviving, the drones will kill you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Order of priority for each class:\n\n* Void High Lord: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, Ultra Engineer\n* Lord of Order: Ultra Engineer \n* Healer/Supports: Attack Drone, Defense Drone, Ultra Engineer\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this guide helps. Please note that this is not an \"end-all-be-all\" guide, just from my experience.\n",

It appears to be 5-3-4-2. If I understand correctly, 3 is the skill that is that is the one that deals a large amount of damage after 10 seconds (if 5 was activated first) in the form of a single  Damage over Time tick.\n\nThe questions I have are: \n\n1. Just in case, are past guides from years ago on this class still relevant?\n\n2. If skill 3 records the damage in a 10 second period, is it the skills or auto attacks that is being recorded that deals most damage (in the form of a single DoT tick)?\n\n3. Since 3 records the damage (if 5 was activated first), isn't it optional to try to spam 2 and 3 in that 10 second time period?\n\n4. Is the 5-3-4-2 the hard gold standard? What I mean is that if I want to do big damage, I must always wait for 5 to finish cooling down then proceed with 3-4-2?\n\n5. During the time that 5 is still cooling down, is there even an optional damage rotation? (It seems to me that 3 is ready to activate once before 5 finishes cooling down.)\n\n6. Assuming character level 100 with highest non-member Lucky enchantments (level 100 Mama Vamp), what is the DoT damage range if one combo was successfully completed? Do subsequent combos increase the DoT damage?\n\nPlease note, I am using this for solo fights and not group fights. I understand that there are also other high DPS classes in group fights that are better than SSoT.\n\nThank you.\n",

            "text": "This is my final post as the last 2 had barely information and proof so I removed them. I can understand why many people did not believe me. People have had good experiences with support but that doesn't mean people can't have bad experiences.  \n\n\nI have been unfairly disabled for the reason of changing my guild name back to the one that was not allowed. Originally my name was not allowed by AE so they mentioned in the guild MOTD that they would change it for me. The problem is that I apparently changed it back to \u201cm i l f t o n i u s\u201d after they changed it to something else, however I can assure you that I did not change the name of the guild. I had changed the guild MOTD numerous times as a joke, yet an officer had also changed the name of the guild MOTD without any prior warning to myself or other members of the guild. Not only that he and other members of my guild have said that the guild name had never changed. They mention the game logs show that yet they have not even shown me them yet.  \n\n\nAlso, why the punishment is so severe regardless? Botting can get you a 3 day temporary ban, where this has rewarded me a indefinite ban. Also, why is it that botter's who have never spent a cent on this game get a temporary ban yet I have spent hundreds of dollars spent over 12 years and I get a indefinite ban for something I did not do?  \n\n\nAnd finally, on the website I found out that Guild Leaders are given 1 free rename coupon, and future name changes will cost 1,000 AC\u2019s. Yet I have not used that free rename coupon, I can definitely say I have not spent AC\u2019s for the Guild name either. Also stated is that \u201cPlayer support cannot change or reverse your guild name, fix typos, or take a guild name from one guild and add it onto another\u201d so unless there is some exception that I am not aware of, they cannot change it by their own rules regardless. Also said is that \u201cThe changed guild name may not show up in game until all the members of the guild re-login to the game\u201d, I can say that several members of my guild have not logged in for 30+ days. Heres proof: [https://www.aq.com/gamedesignnotes/aqw-apr2-nameupdates-8308](https://www.aq.com/gamedesignnotes/aqw-apr2-nameupdates-8308)  \n\n\nAnd to you AE, if this is the way you unfairly treat loyal paying members, in order to keep the sense that Artix never gets anything wrong, it says a lot about your character. And you have lost trust that several members had in your organization. \n\nHere are images of the emails going back and forth between me and support, and the time they changed the guild MOTD: [https://imgur.com/a/5N5fVZ0](https://imgur.com/a/5N5fVZ0)\n\nI think this is everything I have, please help get this message out there as I still do not have a reply from them. I will remove this post if it ends up as AE realising they have made a mistake and give my account back.\n",

Or when you solo a boss and during the cutscene the hero exclaims how close it was, would it kill AE writers and animators to spend a couple extra hours adding different dialogue for your \"power level\"? If I've solo'd Ultra Drakath and all the other end game challenges, I couldn't care less about some random ass knight, if I'm level 100 and Evil, have my character laugh and get excited about getting to annihilate someone not beg side characters for help.\n",

The question is, should I get something that child me would be happy to have after so many years or should I get something that I definitely missed out on post-'17 period. Not interested in anything that is currently farmable in game as there is no point of I can still achieve it. Any suggestions would be great!\n",

            "text": "Alrighty, so I haven't looked too far into it, but from what I understand, AE released all the calendar classes for purchase with buffed abilities making them stronger than before and better than ever. \n\nIn my mind, this is a little backwards. I'm fine they release the calendar classes. I have a few of the og ones and don't mind sharing the love. However, I think the buffs to the classes is a little bit of a slap in the face to those who bought the classes years ago. Personally (and I may be biased), I believe the reworks of the classes should actually have the original skills and then the original classes should have the buffed skills. I think this would be fair as the original skills still are really good and would benefit a lot of players who didn't get the classes when they were first released. But also, it's not completely ignoring the fact that some players bought the classes years ago to have an edge on other players. This way they can still have unique, buffed skills that the new players won't have with the ac purchase class.\n\nI hope that makes sense. Anyways, please let me know your thoughts on the matter and whether or not you agree with me.\n",

            "text": "Half a year ago, I posted a rather scathing and tilted post on the (zero) depth of 'gameplay' in AQW post-2012 era development:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/kcvyc9/aqw\\_had\\_more\\_complex\\_bosses\\_back\\_in\\_2009/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/kcvyc9/aqw_had_more_complex_bosses_back_in_2009/)\n\nIf I was to look at AQW updates from 2013 onwards to 2019, the only common trend of change, WAS no change. The reskinned weekly 'events' being copy paste versions of the previous week with different (and after a few years, the same fucking art with the same monsters renamed) models/backgrounds. No new features had been added in years. Aside from somewhat improving class designs the game was pretty much at a standstill development wise as the game turned entirely into a fashion simulator\n\nWithin this past half year we have seen two particular updates drastically improve the game finally, and show genuine upward trajectory in what really matters in an MMO\n\nA) The awe enhancement update. The importance of this update went really understated in my opinion. How buffed these were and all 5 enhancements finally having unique uses of their own and introducing metas beyond 'Spiral carve everything' added build diversity, and more importantly patched glaring holes in basically every non endgame class that made them at the very least usable if not actually useful. Which considering this applies to a good 95% of classes hugely improved the diversity of practical gameplay that doesnt have you run out of mana 2 femtoseconds in or get twoshot with a nonhealing class\n\ne.g. Horc Evader with the 45 mp Enrage skill on warrior regen model - previously the class was so mana starved you essentially played with 3 skills and Enrage was effectively cosmetic, now with mana vamp this class can actually play as intended, juggling your 3 buff skills with shadow strike.\n\nOr Elemental Dracomancer - tanky, respectable damage but with literally 0 methods of sustain. Now with health vamp you can actually enjoy using this class for more than 6 seconds/against bosses that don't die in 6 seconds\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd \n\nB) Referring back to my post 6 months ago, the devs finally decided to fix the very pressing and for eons forsaken issue of absolutely every last one of the thousands of monsters in the game being the same fucked thing - a lifeless hp sponge.\n\nRegardless of how poorly designed or hastily assembled the 'skillset' of these 3 bosses are, the more important crux of this update - that they have skillsets at all is a damn hallelujah honestly. I pretty much wept internally when I got oneshot by the counter attacking ezrajal for the first time, it was glorious. Thinking at all is something I miss from AQW. And AQW does in fact have room for facilitating thinking, flash engine, 10 FPS and all:\n\nCounter attacks like Alteon/Ezrajal = mechanic demand of halting attacks/disengaging the enemy\n\nLedgermayne's area attacks = mechanic demand of moving around the map. This in particular has serious potential for some skill floor\n\nManticore's poison removable by a button = (admittedly shallow) mechanic demand of clicking on, uh, buttons. This could be creatively made a little bit harder\n\nMonsters affecting the attributes of other monsters like Vath/Stalagbite, or Escherion/Staff of Inversion = this one is really awesome, mechanic demand of target prioritisation and management. Already done pretty well with Engineer, but looking at Vath the devs could really push this one real far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmongst many other more abilities that could be creatively mixed to add legit strategy and coop potential. For example, Kathool's regeneration shield - with numbers fiddled here and there, this could oblige parties to specifically save their nuke skills and time them to destroy the shield asap lest the boss heal back too much health. Or like with Warden and the 1 hp reduction ability, perhaps you have a monster that follows this ability immediately with a single target nuke and you require a tank class with a taunt (such as Dragonslayer's Bane of Scales) to draw aggro and avoid having your DPS or Support get oneshot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut regardless. Whether AQW's devs do manage to utilise their existing tools to the limits, or whether they churn out comparable content to Exaltia, the simple fact that they have finally decided to focus on QOL once more, and reemphasise improving actual gameplay and mechanical elements, leaves me optimistic, immeasurably moreso than the rather nihilistic hateboner relationship I harbored for this game in pretty much the entirety of the last decade. \n\nAnd one day, if I'm feeling seriously delirious and ever overestimate my own personal wealth enough, I might just support this game again and buy a damn 40k AC package. But thats a distant, distant future, and my wallet is faintly stirred but safe for now.\n",

However, it was recently BUFFED. The class that hits harder than VHL *without support*... got BUFFED. WHAT!?\n\nThat's blatantly pay2win, and that sucks!\n\nBut it gets worse! They removed the 40% heal cap and made it so most abilities don't consume Temporal Rift stacks. This means I no longer have to make choices about when to nuke, when to heal, or when to save rift stacks (Example: Save rift stacks to heal after Ezrajal's counter+nuke combo). The class is now a spammer like every other. This update has made it less interesting to play.\n\nBy comparison, I've found niche uses for pretty much every class in AQ3D except Rogue. I'm not here just to praise the vastly superior AQ3D, but to ask AQW dev's to be more reasonable about... Well, everything. Have some standards! I can't even count on 2 hands the number of \"time\" classes anymore and have no way of previewing the classes before choosing 1 to buy with my saved Hero Points. Personally, I would've condensed everything into 1, MAYBE 2 or 3 better designed and fun Chrono classes and just had all the other variants reverted into armors. Then, when you buy a calendar class, you'd have access to the same classes as any other \"Chronomancers.\" Why have so many? Well...\n\nIt's obvious that AE is doing all this in the interest of profits, even going so far as to make the new release all about Chronomancy RIGHT AFTER these classes were proven to be some of the most effective against the new bosses. Now, if players could at least earn like a free Chronomancer variant, this might be OK. But nope! Intstead you get 3/5 Hero Points if you were already active.\n\nI don't know how AE could fix this mess, but I just wanted to vent my thoughts on it all. It's bad.\n",

Thank you to all who believed me and supported me.\n\nBecause of that all thing happening with me supposedly changing the guild name support emailed me back. Now I'm happy I got my account back but this whole support thing is terrible, not only were they unhelpfull the whole way through until I got Alina to help they were lying the whole time too. Even in the last message they told me I could have my account back if I promised to not change the name back. When I got my account back I went to the account manager and got solid proof I never changed it, I hadnt used my free change as you have to use that if you want to change it. I believe the support was offended by the guild name so they decided to lie about me changing the name, its a clear misuse of power and support really needs to be looked into. Especially the one I was talking to (will not name them). Alot of people have had really bad interactions with support some never getting their accounts back. This needs to change.\n",

Excellent for classes with bad mana regen like the popular CDK. Fixes  classes with warrior regen model even before the mana vamp rework was released.\n- 40% crit chance\n- and a whopping 80% crit damage. This alone makes  the class worth it on using it as a support.\n\nSure, if you only have this class alone supporting the entire team, their performance would be mediocre at best. But when paired with other top tier supports like LoO, SC and LR who can provide an excellent haste buff and additional crit chance, your damage dealer's dps would skyrocket.\n",

Just comment in a calm manner and give me your opinion! :)***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't answer the question \"whats the best for solo\" or \"what should I buy\" because its different on each individual case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But heres the method to find out what you need:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore you purchase a chrono you have to pay attention to **4 things (at least)**\n\n\\- Chrono DPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Nuke cooldowns\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The classes you already have\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The role you want to play\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you divide chronos to 3 main category, then you get:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Chronos that are fast, but low DPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Middle category\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) High dps but slow\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you are a first time chrono buyer:**\n\nI recommend to buy something from the top of middle category: Corrupted chronomancer (fast and great DPS)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you already have a chrono:** Immortal or 2019 chrono, (anything that nukes high) you should go down to the \"low dps but fast\" type of chronos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where you have to pay attention to the **chronos individual niche uses** (*totally fine to decide based only the niche use*):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Timekiller:** dodge based solo class can be used to kill high DPS bosses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Chronomancer prime:** 80% crit chance on nuke, but it has no sustain, can be used to kill any normal (DPS) boss really fast\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Commander:** Taunt / debuff chrono, it's going to keep your party alive meanwhile it deals DPS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Chrono corruptor:** Rng based chrono, it has the speed of category 1, but based on RNG your dps might go up to middle category.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **SSoT:** damage is getting better over time, it's insane and well rounded , but it takes time to outperform other chronos (if you stop the combo you lose your DPS) top 1 for chainkills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Infinity knight:** It has some potential but its overall weaker compared to other chronos. (Buff it please! \\^\\^)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Eternal chronomancer:** Its a bit weaker than 2020 and 2019 chronos, but this is the most flexible chrono (temp rift stays active for a long period of time) so you have time to even switch maps between kills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Underworld** and **Corrupted** chronos are the best overall classes to buy if you want something thats great at everywhere. Corrupted is a bit better. (in my opinion) Great DPS, fast. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Chrono dragonknight:** The class is pure dps. It has no sustain and cant be use for solo, but the party DPS is godlike... like... GODLIKE!  \n\n\n\\- **Nechronomancer:** This is a really fast, and powerful farm class.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nIts your decision to choose whatever you want, but I hope this helps a bit.  \nGive me your opinion! You like it? What would you change? :)\n",

Once we have that they may begin to focus more on improving QoL of aqw which is currently hot garbage and the game may finally actually evolve.\n",

I wonder if the game will survive until AQ Mobile or will still live well on Mobile, the game right now is basically a slot machine that you collect and buy the best items with actual money.\n\nI guess at least add transmog so that people can use their favorite items with the damage boost that they have ?\n",

And since I don't run a YouTube channel...here you go.\n\n# Chaos Rift Strike\n\n\\-Deals damage to the target and applies Chaos Rift to you. Stacks to 4 and lasts 30 seconds.\n\n# Split Causality \n\n\\-Applies a small or large HoT to yourself, and a small or large DoT to your target. The small effects last 8 seconds and the large effects last 2 seconds. \n\n \n\n* Applies either Restore Time, a small HoT over 8 seconds or Mend Time, a large HoT over 2 seconds.\n* Applies either Time Bleed, a small DoT over 8 seconds or Time Hemorrhage, a large DoT over 2 seconds.\n\n# Time Collapse \n\n\\-If Chaos Rift is active, deal damage to your target based on the amount you've dealt in up to the past 10 seconds while it was active. Damage scales with each stack of Chaos Rift and consumes those stacks. \n\n# Don\u2019t Blink Twice \n\n\\-Deals a large amount of damage to your target and applies Distorted Time to yourself, increasing your Haste by 20% for 15 seconds. Chaos empowers you, either applying Visceral Shift, which increases your outgoing physical damage by 100%, or Shiftburn, which increases your HoT and DoT power by 100%. Both effects last 5 seconds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's important to ALWAYS have Chaos Rift stacked on you at all times in order for \"Time Collapse\" to deal damage (as it deals literally nothing if no stacks are applied) while dealing as much damage as you can for a short amount of time. For this, I recommend this\n\n    Combo:\n    1-4-2-1-1-1-3 (Maximum Damage) \n    OR\n    1-1-4-2-1-1-3 (Safer Option)\n\nLike I said, it's important to always have Chaos Rift Stacked, so using your first skill in every fight is a must so that it still counts in the \"Time Collapses\" 's 10 seconds. In order to maximize your damage, you first would need to have 1 Stack of Chaos Rift, followed by your 4th and 2nd skill. What this does is that the first stack would count the damage coming from the 4th and 2nd skill (doesn't matter if you get Visceral Shift or Shiftburn. Just follow the combo as normal). After you've dealt as much damage as you could (or just having 4 stacks of Chaos Rift) within 10 seconds, quickly use your 3rd Skill in order to deal the Nuke damage (or if you're lazy to count, look at Split Casualty's Cooldown. If there's only a quarter/3 seconds left, then that's less or on point of 10 seconds. If that is still too difficult, just remember to get 4 stacks of Chaos Shift)\n\nThe class performs well in both Solos AND Groups. The spammable skills and decent heal allows it to farm, but I don't recommend it. Avoid using this class against hard hitting bosses as it lacks any defensive Buffs or Debuffs aside from healing.\n\nThings to remember:\n\n\\-Your timing MUST be precise. If 10 seconds has passed and you have not used your 3rd Skill, you will deal immensely less damage. If you used your 3rd skill too early, then you will also deal less damage\n\n\\-I recommend Luck Enchantments. The more damage you do, the more the 3rd Skill's Nuke will bring\n\n\\-There's a very weird bug where you would instantly deal 1M damage to a target with your first (basic) attack. I don't know what causes this, but let's keep it between us, shall we?\n\n***Note:*** The class isn't amazing, let's be real here. It's still a decent Chrono Class and can still perform really well but it lacks more on what the others do and don't have. I only bought it for myself since it's Chaos. But AE, if you're listening, from a person who despise your work ethics: Please do the right thing and buff Chaorrupter. It's the least you could do after ruining Chaos (and only giving us 3 Chaos Classes)\n",

How do i know that? Because its the latest class the newer the class the better it is they try their best to create new chronos as best as possible so people would buy it. Ofc they wouldnt create worse chrono than they created before than we woudnt buy it because it wouldnt make sence to buy worse class. Also it depends on you if you want to farm or kill bosses. Btw those classes are not realesed so you should save up your points for those classes! :)\n",

There's literally no more reason to create end game classes since they won't ever be better than chrono classes.\n\n\n\nIt's so mind-boggling, even if the excuse is \"it's a die or die situation\" no its fucking not.

After a 1 year all my friends stopped playing while I continued. This game was always about boring grindings and repetitive button mashing.\n\nThese bosses in Time Inn changed everything. I gave it a try after 1 week(?) of their release and holy shit they are hard. At first it kinda annoyed me because, like most who complained, I couldn't do everything by myself. But after changing rooms and servers, I've met 2 wonderful players who were in desperate need of a support class. We discussed class combinations, each boss strategy, and similar stuff. For the first time in ages I was excited to defeat a boss and feeling like in a true MMORPG, where comps and strategy matters.\n\nWe know AE screws up a lot of stuff and they are very lazy sometimes, but these last two updates were excellent and really brought my interest back into the game. They probably don't visit the subreddit, but, if somehow one of them do, I want you guys to know that you nailed it with these bosses, congratulations.\n",

All u need is a party with LR, CDK, SC, and AP/LoO. The LR and CDK focus the defense drone so the CDK can prestack while the SC and AP/LoO focus the attack drone. Once both drones are down, the CDK runs up to the Ultra Engineer and presses 4 -> 5, killing it in 1 hit. This strategy is pretty reliable, and we call it \"8 Sec Engi\". Just posting this here in case it helps someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: This is not from my PoV, my friend recorded it for our guild chat.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/omeruc/video/w68zxw1osub71/player\n",

I swear I have once seen someone using the class Void Highlord (IoDA) but I have never seen it again so I'm not sure if I just imagined it. My second question would be is it worth to claim the darkside class? now that the seasonal new version is out it feels like a waste but darkside is still rare so im not sure. Finally, does anyone have any cool suggestions for items not normally thought about? Besides classes, I would be most interested in armors or pets\n",

First Class Entertainment at /LegionArena\n\n2. Legion Loyalty Rewarded\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst Class Entertainment: \n\n1. This quest is good for those players that has dedicated friends or if you got lucky and you are in a room full of people.\n2. This quest also needs a good fking luck to turn in, because the quest item drops at like 4% drop rate. In my experience in under 2 hours I only got 1 axeros' brooch which is really unlucky of me, but sometimes I can get 360 in 2 hours.\n3. Sometimes the RNG Gods likes to mess up my luck and gives me nothing for almost 4 hours.\n\nLegion Loyalty Rewarded\n\n1. This quest needs a lot of grinding as it takes more than 5 bosses to kill, but it will only take like 20-30 seconds depending on the class and level you are.\n2. This gives 100% 5 legion tokens per turn ins.\n3. I tested this quest for 1 hour. I completed the quest for approximately 4 mins and 30 seconds. If we will compare this to axeros' brooch, you will get 120 Legion Tokens for 1 hour and 40 mins.\n4. This quest will also be needed for farming Legion Revenant as you will need these for farming the Diamond Token of Dage.\n\nThat is my notes for grinding Legion Tokens for Non-Members, Now I am wondering if there are anything that can help me decide which is better, I would gladly read that, Thank you!\n",

Did Blaze Binder get nerfed?\n",

I immediately room hopped to see if he was hopping to another ultraengineer room and true enough I found him in another room but this time he was already afk. It is clear he intentionally afked because only seconds had passed which was not enough for the game to auto afk so he definitely room hopped before making himself afk there. It is also likely that he room hops into a lower number room (ultraengineer-1 or -2 etc) so that more people will enter the room with him afking there.\n\nWhile I have also seen others afk, they don't do it intentionally and I definitely don't see them blatantly doing it in these boss rooms repeatedly where players are capped to 4. This guy is single-handedly ruining the fun of players and hard work of the staff who put in effort to bring these interesting boss fight additions to the game. This is important as seeing the direction of ae it is likely similar events/boss fights will be released in future and if we do not stop this type of disruptive behaviour then it will persist in the future.\n\nAlthough the report categories are rather limited and his behaviour falls in a grey area not explicitly covered by the rules, it is clear that this behaviour is unacceptable and disruptive especially in the context of the timeinn bossfights with room limits of 4 players.

The more reports we get through of this guy the higher the chance of mods and staff noticing this problem and doing something about it. He is usually in Artix server and in one of the ultraengineer rooms, likely a lower numbered room. I usually find him after the day resets at 12am+ or 1am+ but I'm not sure how long he stays there each day. With that said, please do not type vulgarities in chat or threaten him in game as not only will it not help, it will also likely get you into trouble with ae as well. Lets all do this through proper channels if we really want something done about the problem.\n\n(TLDR) To everyone: I hope we can all play our part in reporting him to the mods and spreading the message. Simply spend a couple of moments in Artix server room hopping in ultraengineer and you'll very likely find him afk in one of the rooms.  If he is there, report him and describe the situation. He often wears a troll face helm but as seen in the picture that is not always the case. If we can successfully raise this matter to the staff's attention, it will set a precedence for how such behaviour (Intentional AFKing) will be dealt with and tackled in future, especially with similar maps and boss fights potentially coming out in the near future.

So for example if you equip a +5% damage item first, then equip a +3% damage item, you're only going to benefit from the +3% bonus and not any damage boost from before. \n\nHowever, different boosts can be used together (ex: reputation boost from cape, damage boost from weapon, gold boost from helm) and active timed boosts will stack with gear boosts.\n\nhttps://www.aq.com/lore/Guides/AQWBoosts\n",

If you want a 30% damage boost weapon then go beat Aranx.\n\nHaving high health is very important in these battles especially against Ultra Ezrajal that can one shot anybody with less than ~3000 health and Ultra Engineer himself and the attack drone. You need to be able to stay alive until you get healed by the supports.\n\nHaving a level requirement of at least level 85 will keep away the one shotted bois and the discount level 1 trolls.\n\nThe AFK timer (which should be 10 minutes minimum) will move the trolls and legit AFK players to their house or battleon. Maybe even a playtime filter to further avoid trolls who bot their account quickly to high levels, if that's possible.\n\nThe AFK griefing was always a thing but to a lesser extent. IMO every room that can hold less than 6 players needs an AFK boot timer.\n",

The only thing different now is that I was farming Escherion and got the drop under 10 mins and he was supposed to be about 0.05%. Idk if I'm either super lucky or they changed the drop rates.\n",

If you want a 30% damage boost weapon then go beat Aranx. Someone below level 85 has no reason to be here, and i'm saying level 85 because they might prefarm those items for later because they give a lot of exp.\n\nHaving high health is very important in these battles especially against Ultra Ezrajal that can one shot anybody with less than ~3000 health and Ultra Engineer himself and the attack drone. You need to be able to stay alive until you get healed by the supports. Having a level requirement of at least level 85 will keep away the one shotted bois and the discount level 1 trolls.\n\nThe AFK timer (which should be 10 minutes minimum) will move the trolls and anyone who's AFK for real to their house or battleon.\n\nThe AFK griefing was always a thing but to a lesser extent. IMO every room that can hold less than 6 players needs an AFK boot timer. Some longer than others.\n\nAlso add a freaking report option for griefing. I don't think people sabotaging others or do other things to annoy people can be considered harassment, because that's the closest option we have.\n",

Click *Let's go* and J6 will ask you one more time. Once again, click *Let's go*. You and J6 will travel to **Hyperspace** (/join hyperspace). Hyperspace is not a locked zone, so you will be able to /join this map. Once you get there, go to the VR room and click on the screen.  \n\n\nAfter the cutscene finishes, go speak to H.A.L. in the Command Center and play the Memory Challenge mini-game. You will need 1000 points in the mini-game in order to defeat H.A.L. The mini-game consists of looking at a series of pictures and then picking out the one that wasn't shown. You have as much time as you want to remember the images, but you must reach 1000 points before the timer runs out. If you are having trouble getting through this mini-game, try writing down what the items are, or taking a picture or screenshot of the items.  \n \"\"\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been running through both maps to see if I missed something but I can not start the minigame, my VR screen says \"Offline\" and H.A.L. just says \"System Offline\". J6 tells me to speak to HAL in hyperspace, and he just takes me here when I speak with him in hyperium. Watching cutsene from hyperium also takes me to this map.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something or is there a chance is it currently bugged?

I have played AQW on-off since 2008, and I haven't seen ever played like currently when doing the challenge quests. Since there's a limit to 4 players per room, you have to wait till you have a 4-room (which is not that long of a wait on artix, galanoth) and what's better is you actually have to co-ordinate with the people in your room. Never before have I actually had to type in chat to co-ordinate with my room. Things like when to apply buff before the fight, what class who is using (ie. lord of order, legion revenant, lightcaster, calendar class). Even though it's 3 daily quests, it's just nice to be able to go around rooms and co-ordinate with other players when playing the game. What do you guys think of the challenge quests and the way you have to fight the bosses?\n",

Can solo hard hitter bosses. generally - a tank supporter\n\nChrono Dragon Knight - good DPS, convenient temporal stacks, with a good team you can kill bosses at ease. Can end fights easily, generally - damage dealer >!(like the way sync intended it to be)!<\n\nI have to ask, which class is generally better? People have been mentioning that CDK is only good in group fights, so it discourages me to get CDK and instead go for Chrono Commander because of what it can contribute more, which is what bothers me since nobody gives the downsides of having Chrono Commander. \n\nSo if you have free time, just downright tell me your reasoning regarding CDK and CC and why the other is better or not. Also, if CDK is better how come no one is using it against bosses like the Ultra Engineer? \n\n(of course, if you have one of these classes, that would be much credible for me to conclude upon)\n",

Soloing (regular bosses)\nFor bosses that hit under 500, you won't need to pre-stack your 3-skill. You can just right away start with 2 than use 5, than two again (you have 3 stacks of Deadlock at this point, meaning that your next skill will apply it's Rift stack.) than 5 once again. If you started getting TR stacks, you're doing good, so max tham out. (4). Don't bother maxing out your IR stacks tho, as they have no impact on your damage. Than use 3-4 to nuke. \n\nSo, here's the solo (A) combo , assuming you don't miss/enemy doesn't dodge :\n2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-3-4 \nKeep in mind, that if you miss, Rift stacks won't apply. ONLY MAKE UP FOR STACKS IF 5 MISSES. DON'T BOTHER WITH 2. \n\nb. Soloing (bosses with 250DPS+)\n\nIn this case (and only in this case)\n\nPre-stack 3, 3 times, do the combo above, but now, make up for every missed stack, as they will help you sustain. \n\nc. Groups. \nBasically, \"a\" but with 13 million (my highest lol) crits. Again, don't bother getting max stacks of 2, or pre-stacking 3)\n",

I'm not just talking about the VHL guys in the ultra rooms for Apotheosis but also in other farms. While trying to grind for LR I found a room full of farming classes to kill Aeacus which makes no sense. I asked one dude to switch to LC so I can kill faster with a TK. He told me that Chrono commandant is much faster so I assumed he'd use it but all I saw was Blaze binder. I get that you're farming something but atleast use a solo/support class when it's a boss to make it efficient. Yes, I also tried to use LC/SC in that room but that compromised the Dps so much that I had to go back to TK. I'd rather deal with bot rooms where nobody responds than this tbh. For anyone interested in the class composition of the room, here it is\n2 Blaze Binder\n2 Infinite Legion Dark Caster\n1 Scarlet Sorceress\n1 Timekiller (me)\n",

Maybe LR is still arguably the best farmer class along with MoM and Nechrono but VHL is completely annihilated. Timekeeper just left VHL powerless just like VHL left Necromancer forgotten. I would love the idea of stronger classes with harder way to obtain. This free Calendar Class stuff has caused something like inflation of class power. But it is what it is, I got 4 accounts with a different Calendar Class each and I enjoy it. Thanks VHL for helping me to obtain LR, NSoD, SDKA, DoT, BoA, BLoD, Drakath Armor, you name it.\n",

Also, I do already have a bank pet and have lightcaster. I have considered buying Sepulchure\u2019s Undead Blade but I decided not to. I already have a Naval Commander and one is enough. I am not interested in getting any other calendar class either. Furthermore, I have thought about spending everything on the Wheel Of Doom but arrived to the conclusion that it\u2019s a bad ideea.Also I don\u2019t intend to spend them on inventory/ bank spaces. I really don\u2019t know what I should spend it all on? Any ideeas?\n\nP.S: I did not pay for them. A friend of mine lost a bet and he thought that since we were both playing AQWorlds he\u2019d repay his debt this way but idk what to use em on.\n",

Then they just leave the map, so then new people who are entering the map will report the innocent players instead.\n\nIf you did get banned for filling a map to thwart these level 1 players, just contact Player Support to explain that you were filling the map because there was already an AFK player there. Hopefully they'll understand and start implementing a level lock to the maps instead of just banning players.\n",

My goal for nostalgia purposes and to satisfy my completionist nature is to 100% all of the story. \n\nSo, I was wondering if there were any open casual guilds that farm together or help with bosses? I have a 12 year old account but am sadly, it's still only level 67 lol so some stuff can still be a challenge. It would be awesome to have a community to play and farm with. \n\nDoes anyone on here have a guild that's recruiting that would be interested in me?\n\nMy username in game is Zhephyre.\n\nThanks!\n",

Want to know if there's any cool map or story to explore, the in-game map is trash and I don't think it shows everything. \n\nWhen I returned to the game, I'd check out where players get their item by looking at their character page and then on the wiki. That's mostly how I find new (to me) maps. There was this one with really amazing backgrounds. I think it was called somnia.\n\nAside from that, darkon's saga, summer break, new recent releases, and the one with the purple dragon, I haven't seen much of the previous releases. \n\nI call em hidden maps cuz there's really no other way, that I know of, to access these maps unless you know their names, check the wiki, or maybe it's in the map. Kind of a shame so much content is just waiting to collect dust as these maps would usually be empty but ig that's how even the 13 lords of chaos storyline maps are nowadays.\n\nOh and pls no maps related to the chaos storyline after drakath becomes a feet-lick-begging beta simp (start of queen of monster storyline)\n",

Kitsune was one of our favourite bosses back then so we had to buy the member upgrade because we wanted to look like him. I dont even know how but for 20$ each we both ended up with 9k AC so we have quite a bit.\n\nMy question is however: How do we spend it without ruining the game experience ? Let's say i just buy the best class i can in the game for AC then theres practically no more for me right? I still want the grind with getting new classes kinda.\n\nMy second question is: I was thinking if it'd be worth just buying mid-tier classes for AC? but then again most people would say that would be complete waste.\n\nThird question is: Should i buy cosmetics..?\n\nAny help greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n\\*Member + 9k AC\\*\n",

Idk if It's still possible to loop it or not present day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I know: The principle is that you build up your damage with the combo and by the time you hit the nuke, there is a delay before the Dot comes. At that time, you can reapply the rift which when the Dot Nuke arrives, it would be counted for the next nuke. Theoretically, if you pull this right, your nuke would exponentially increase in damage. However, I'll I'm getting is a constant 20 - 40k damage\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm doing and combo I'm using: Starter (2-3-5-2-4-3) then alternate between Single Nuke(5-4-3-2)  and double (5-3-4-2-3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see the Rift apply before the Dot however it isn't increasing. I'm attempting this solo so Idk if I need support or anything.\n",

Considering I have NSoD (and dual NSoD for enhancement flexibility between luck and wiz) this isn't much of a problem cause I don't need it, but I fear that this buff will affect the game greatly in the future, especially when people stop coming to those ultra bosses room making the farming even harder for future players.

The game was so boring with all the punching bag bosses, that required no planning, thinking, nor team coordination. This is the hardness what we deserve for endgame items, not the mindless dull 100 hour grinds we got in the past several years. \n\nI was begging for boss skills like this ever since the chaos lord saga ended, and I can't express how happy I am to see this implemented ingame.\n\nMaybe we will see something similar like in Dragonfable where they rework old iconic bosses and add them to their Inn challenge map to farm endgame items. That would be the best thing for a long time. (Not to mention the amount of content they can come up this way)\n\nI welcome aqlite merge too. Personally it will not change my experience because I have already use it for years, but im glad it will be available to every player as an official thing. Great thing!\n\nAbout the calendar class changes. With the wide and easy access to overpowered calendar classes, it was inevitable to see huge nerfs. I don't want to say much about since we don't know yet the final change. But I can see the reason why the devs do it and I'm 100% behind them. Most of theese original prebuff classes were very situational and underused anyways. And the ones who cry the loudest about the nerfs the ones who got it for free.\n\nI can see AE try to fix their mistakes, and try to do it in the best way. So stop complaining and \n\nBig thumbs up to AE!\n",

Dodge is better than damage reduction against OHKO bosses, a class that have this, and one of the highest nukes is pretty unfair. By nerfing the nuke and keeping the dodge, Timekeeper would still be the \"dodge chrono\"  and solo OHKO bosses but would sacrifice the high nuke for that (the class should still nuke, but not for as much as it once did). If they keep the nuke and remove the dodge, the class would lose it's identity IMO(why pick it when you could choose others who nuke harder?)\n\nSsot nerf should be applied on the spawm kill bullshit. I know, it's fun and saves a lot of time, but seeing it from a game developer point of view, would you agree with it? The rest of the class is pretty fair, high skill cap(most people don't know how to use it to this day) balanced with a good dps, the nuke isn't as high as the other chronoclasses and to get the best dps you have to sacrifice it's survivability(to a certain extent). Maybe I'm a but biased toward this class, but this spawm kill is the only thing I found \"unhealthy\" about it.\n\nDo you guys agree? What do you think about it? If it's nerfed, should be in this way or another way?\n",

Best crew ever. We started from Day 2 of the Ultra Event up until we got the items.

After the Chrono Event, we experimented with a CDK lineup and had to have a good schedule for all of us to be online at the same time. We won a lot, ROFLed a few times,  and experienced the satisfaction of proccing PWD on the 3 bosses in the same run.

After the nuke cap, I've found that the problem with the engineer battle isn't shredding the engineer's hp, but keeping the drones dead. TK's nukes still do full damage against the exalted drones, so with a team of TK, LR, SC/LC, and LOO, use the TK to 1 shot the drones, and get ~150k damage a nuke on engineer while the drones are gone. Even if drones come back, TK one taps the drones quickly, allowing you to beat ultra engineer without too much hassle.\n",

            "text": "I want to see what other people think are classes that need to be changed. I only have four classes I can think of immediately that deserve some love, so I'll share those. Let me know if you have any others.   \n1. Chaos Shaper.\n\nNot to be confused with Chaos Slayer, Chaos Shaper is a class anyone who purchases 15 months of membership can get. It used to be a fairly good class, but that was back when it released. Now-a-days it is feels less like a reward for players who show interest in supporting the devs and more like another random piece of crap to slap into your bank. I have nostalgia for this class, I used to love using it back when it released, and given how it requires 15 months of membership, I feel it should at least be comparable to Mindbreaker in terms of power. \n\n2. Bloodtitan.\n\nI cannot test the class now-a-days due to lacking membership, but as I recall this class was always fairly disappointing. It is more or less a proto-Scarlet Sorceress, using a similar model for its skills. However, it is meant to be a beefy tank. My main issue with the class is how absurdly low its haste is, meaning the time between every skill usage agonizing, and your DPS will always feel lackluster. \n\n3. Blood Ancient.\n\nA class that came out in the same era of AQW as bloodtitan, but it is a lot closer to the original Timekiller, a pvp orientated class that is more or less just a slight variation of Vindicator of They. Not very worth getting, and it was never particularly good even in pvp.   \n\n\n4. Legendary  Hero.\n\nThis class has always been awful. It is designed to be a party orientated support, however even when it  came out it was already outclassed in that regard. It has a stacking mechanic on its two skill that stacks 25 times (10 more than Infinity Knight) with a long cooldown, not to mention it also applies Focus on your target. This is not helped by the fact the class has abyssmal haste. What does this stacking skill work toward? A pitiful \"nuke\" skill that only crits in the low thousands (1-3k) at 25 stacks, and this is with Spiral Carve Apoth. Not only that, but it hits every enemy in your current room, meaning not only is the main target focusing you, but everything else in the room is if applicable. Don't be worried though, it heals you. How much? Not enough to make its  45 second cooldown worth it. In all fairness, its 3 and 4  skills are solid enough, however the 2 and 5 break any semblance of worth this class could ever have, and its rank 4 passives aren't really that useful. I don't know what I would do to this class, but at this point I would rather it be a reskin of another class than the class it currently is.  \n\n\nThat concludes my thoughts.\n",

            "text": "So I haven\u2019t played since they raised the level cap past 80. Been playing for a few weeks on and off and recently got caught up with the whole Chrono class issues. I had purchased SWoT and ICM with AC\u2019s back when they were released. I was still debating whether or not to save my HP\u2019s or just cash in, but after the recent nerfs the move is definitely to save them. I agree with those that bring up this as an issue , while mostly pertaining to past marketing strategies that AE took. \nThere was a point in time when all players recognized that these chrono classes were just busted. They all had flaws too of course, but the incentive to go out of your way to purchase their company\u2019s products just so you could unlock these in-game was there, it was supposed to be exclusive and available to only those who took the time and money out of their day to get them. \nFast-forward to today, and AE decides to give everyone a free chrono. Keep in mind that the whole reason this happened is due to a technical error on their end giving out 6 HP\u2019s accidentally and randomly. Their solution to their mistake was just to give everyone enough to get a chrono, which of course led to an overload of chrono users. It wasn\u2019t even a month before they realized that it was a terrible decision, and decided to nerf them all to shreds so that level 20 Chronomancers don\u2019t just cheese their way through literally all content. \nMy point is this, this whole process has been kind of a fuck you to the people who back in the day actually spent money for these things because it was being marketed at the time as being \u201cextremely powerful\u201d and \u201chighly-exclusive\u201d. I personally don\u2019t care about them saying that, as I said I play very infrequently, but I understand the perspective of those who are complaining heavily about the whole \u201cchrono scandal\u201d. Anyone else feel similarly? If not, how do you justify their actions?\n",

It gives you a 50% endurance boost which translates to around 33% more max health. Very useful for Ultra Ezrajal and Engineer. The difference is pretty big. Ultra Ezrajal will usually deal 2800 damage with his nuke, so after you get hit instead of having only 200-300 health you'll have around 1000. You won't get one shotted by his normal attacks after that. \n\nUltra Engineer's nuke deals around the same damage as Ezrajal but he'll also immediately hit everybody with a 1000-1100 damage normal attack right after it. If you couldn't time a heal between the nuke and his normal hit the whole party will be wiped out. This potion allows you to take both hits and still live.\n\nLord or Order make this potion even more effective. This potion is not effective against Ultra Warden because he'll reduce your HP to 1 no matter what.\n\n- Felicious Philtre. It gives you a 50% luck stat boost. Basically your already fat crits will become even fatter. Useful for Ultra Warden because you need to kill him as soon as possible\n\n- Potion of Evasion. Boosts your dodge chance and haste (though haste will most likely be maxed out from support classes). Also very useful against Ultra Warden when he goes berserk because it reduces the chance of him hitting you with a normal attack after his 1 hp nuke.\n",

But I'd rather prefer that, knowing that we will kill the boss effectively and without much loss. \n\nWhen I played FrostBarbarian, I can pretty much guarantee that you don't even need to press T when Ultraezrajal counterattacks. You can tank it and still survive, and I only died **'once'** in the entire 3-5 minutes it took us to kill the boss. Which is the best selling point in my opinion, thats without even having a single potion in use. If were to use Felicious phirite then I can guarantee that I wouldn't die even once.\n",

Today with so many items, 10k chests of acs, hard farm, things just seem far away. Every time I go back to this game, expectations drop over the days and again I'm closing aqw to never return, until nostalgia calls me again, in another cycle of expectations. My account just looks bad, like it could be better. I would like to invest a little, spent some time, buy some nice items, but dollars is simply expensive. I wonder if anyone else feels that way, I miss simplicity, I miss simplicity so much from a game that marked my childhood that I would go back in time, just to rejoice in the simple things.  \n\n\nSorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my native language, and I'm a bit rusty.

I think it\u2019d be awesome if some of the really rare items we have could be made a nft on a blockchain. I\u2019m not too knowledgable of the tech behind this or anything but all I know is that would make aqw blow up all over again and would drive MASSIVE amounts of players to the game, especially since theyve been an established game for so long but have since be slowly sizzling out. I think it would bring back hundreds of thousands of old players and aqw used to be one of my favorite games as a kid and itd be dope to have a new reason to play it again with all my rares on my account i hoarded over the years. Even the #1 play to earn crypto nft play to earn game i play (Cryptoblades) creator has mentioned taking inspiration from the original Adventure quest in the rpg browser game style. Just my 2 cents. Do your research on the stuff a little, i think it could be huge for this game if they ever decided to venture into this new uncharted territory of play to earn crypto games.\n",

I am a player that has played AQW on and off frequently over the years, and I just got back to the game after a long hiatus and I've decided to stick with the game and try grinding it out, but I want a class that is good for farming or boss fights (would be nice if both).** **My account name is Unikarnz, I am level 36, I have 712,054 gold with 2087 AC**, and I use 2 main classes for now, nu metal necro and rogue, but mainly nu metal since I've gotten him.  \n\nMy highest reputations are Doomwood at rank 7 (3350/51200), Arcanegrove, Chronospan, Sandsea and Thunderforge at rank 6, and Mythsong and troll at rank 5. I do not remember all the quests I've completed over the years, but as long as I can **I am completely willing to help in answering any questions as long as I can check it.** Regarding the 13 lords of chaos, I've completed most places aside from Bloodtusk Ravine (cant kill khasaandra alone, and havent finished orc), Swordhaven (stopped at chaorruption rises cutscene), Mirror realm (stopped at the horror of chaos cutscene) and the chaos finale (did nothing in that). \n\n**According to the previous info, is there something I can grind that will help me out in getting a nice class?** If there is any extra info needed I can provide. I am so sorry if this is a post where you would think that I am lazy and did not do my research on classes, but whenever I try I find the best ever classes that I cannot reach right now like blaze binder or void highlord or something or like beginner lvl 10 or something classes like warrior and whatnot, and I am ignorant on the good places to farm for monsters . **I am also willing to spend my AC on a good class that will be worth it. I also forgot what most of my inventory items do, which is why I am asking for guidance on reddit.**\n\nI am sorry if this is a long and troublesome post, but I think that this is my first/second post on reddit and I do not know how things go here, and I came here to ask for help, so I do hope that the AQW community helps me out, and I am sorry if I typed something that might have offended you or incorrect, so please guide me and correct me my seniors, and ***I wish you a good day today whenever you read this, whoever you are, and know that I love all of you :)***\n",

            "text": "**Class Changes for August 6, 202**\n\nToday\u2019s update brings changes to a few classes that saw an unexpected power spike in PvP with the introduction of the Mythril PvP Amulet and Awe Enhancement updates. Additionally, we have also made adjustments to a few of the calendar classes and have given a certain Nulgath Nation class a much needed buff. \n\n\nChronoCorruptor/ChronoChaorruptor\n\nChronoCorruptor is already in a pretty good spot, but although its Visceral Shift and Shiftburn auras are powerful, they did not last as long as they needed to. These changes should increase the overall power of the two auras.\n\nDon\u2019t Blink Twice:\n- Visceral Shift Physical Damage increase: 100% > 75%\n- Visceral Shift duration: 5 seconds > 8 seconds\n- Shiftburn HoT and DoT power increase: 100% > 75%\n- Shiftburn duration: 5 seconds > 8 seconds\n\n\nDragon of Time\n\nTuning down Dragon of Time\u2019s sustain in PvP and increasing its overall PvE performance.\n\nDragon\u2019s Will:\n- Can now miss\n\nConvergence of Destiny\n- Maximum Discordance stacks: 20 > 25\n\n\nFrost SpiritReaver\n\nIn PvP, Frost SpiritReaver was incredibly dominant in most matchups. Reducing its stat debuffs and Haste passive should give classes more opportunities to combat it.\n\nSpirit Freeze:\n- Spirit Chill Haste and Dodge debuff: 15% > 10%\n\nSpirit Charge:\n- Fully Synchronized Spirit outgoing magic damage buff: 150% > 200%\n\nSpirit Banishment:\n- Spirit Damage Hit Chance debuff: 50% > 25%\n- Spirit Devastation incoming damage debuff: 30% > 15%\n\nSpirit Synchronization:\n\n- Spirit Shattering incoming damage debuff: 20% > 15%\n\nSpirit Chill:\n- Outgoing damage: 15% > 10%\n\nSpirit Blink:\n- Haste: 100% > 30% (total Haste still exceeds the 50% cap, but can now be slowed by many more debuffs)\n\nSpirit Reckoning:\n- Crit Damage: 30% > 50%\nInfinity Knight/Interstellar Knight\n\nInfinity Knight was lacking in performance compared to the other calendar classes, so it is getting a much needed tune-up.\n\nStat Model:\n- Changed to Mage\n\nStrike of Dawn:\n- No longer misses, but can\u2019t crit\n- Cooldown: 2 seconds > 1.5 seconds\n\nIncinerating Era:\n- DoT damage increased\n- DoT duration: 10 seconds > 6 seconds\n\nEquinox:\n- No longer misses, but can\u2019t crit\n\nNot a Second Wasted:\n- HoT and DoT Power: 12% > 30%\n\n\nSentinel\n\nThe new PvP amulet resulted in Sentinel being able to instantly deal a large amount of unavoidable damage, these changes aim to add more counterplay to it.\n\nSentinel\u2019s Strike:\n- No longer guaranteed to hit, but still always crits\n\nPurge The Wicked:\n- Damage increased\n\n\nShadowWalker/Stalker/Weaver of Time\n\nReducing the efficiency of ShadowWalker\u2019s infinite DoT scaling while reducing mana costs and greatly increasing the base damage of its skills. Overall, ShadowWalker\u2019s DoT numbers will be lower than they were previously, but the increase to the base damage of its skills should keep its performance at an appropriate level for a calendar class.\n\nRift of Shadows:\n- Base damage increased\n\nExude/Devour:\n- Base damage increased\n\nVendetta/Umbral Stigma\n- Base damage increased\n- Umbral Stigma DoT damage reduced\n- Mana Cost: 30 > 20\n\nSilhouette/Shadow Warp\n- Base damage increased\n\nShadowWalker has also received a few changes that are focused towards PvP. These changes have little to no impact on PvE performance.\n\nTemporal Eclipse:\n- Shadowed State no longer reduces enemy Crit Chance\n- Temporal Eclipse no longer increases Hit Chance\n- Turbulent Rift Haste buff: 100% > 30% (total Haste still exceeds the 50% cap on use)\nVindicator of They\n\nIn PvP, Vindicator of They is able to consistently stunlock its opponent, making it difficult to interact with. Therefore, we are adjusting its stun duration, but increasing its overall damage output.\n\nWe Want A Rock:\n- Petrify duration: 4 seconds > 2 seconds\n\nMass of Incandescent Gas:\n- Now has a 50% increased chance to crit\n\nHot Cha:\n- Haste: 20% > 25% (The Collector Class shares this passive with Vindicator of They, so they both got the increase)\n\n\nVoid Highlord\n\nVoid Highlord\u2019s current performance does not properly reflect the amount of effort that it takes to obtain it. These changes aim to bring it back up to a suitable power level, while modestly keeping it in check for PvP.\n\nContract:\n- At rank 10, now applies an aura called Abyssal Sacrifice to the target, which increases incoming physical damage by 5% for 8 seconds, stacks to 20.\n\nShackle and Unshackle:\n- Soul Void now increases HoT and DoT power by 30%\n\nHighlord\u2019s Gaze:\n- Mana Cost: 20 > 30\n\nArmageddon:\n- Arbiter\u2019s Wrath Crit Damage buff: 30% > 75%\n- Arbiter\u2019s Wrath duration: 8 seconds > 12 seconds\n- Mana Cost: 50 > 60\n",

THE EVER FLYING FUCK IS UP WITH THAT? These bosses hit like a fucking truck and have HP in the millions, so now you're stuck dedicating the entire team into low DPS healing classes just to scrape by, leaving you stuck in a fight for a goddamned hour while everyone STILL keeps dying over and over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck you AE. Keep your fucking badges, I'm fucking done with your so-called \"challenge bosses\". I'm so angry and disappointed with you, I don't want to slap you in the face, because that wouldn't be painful enough. I wanna strap you to your office chair and fucking MAKE you goddamn play your own fucking game for once. See if you still have such a hard on for these cancer bosses after dying to them 50 times in a row without even putting a dent in them.\n",

Arch pally will give dmg reduction, LC will give the heals, SC will buff the dmg of the party and LoO for its immunity(tips for LoO users use your immunity when Kala is about to use his DoT), LC can be swaped With LR if There is no LC\n\nIf you dont have a party i advice you to enter a room with one of the classes mentioned then tell the other people in the room to use the other classes, stategize your fight dot just bindly go in.\n\nThings to not do:\n\nDo not use VHL or any class with self dmg as the  self dmg which can kill the user when the Kala DoT is active.\n\nDo not use TK because Kala Deals dmg with DoT and evasion doesnt help with that and the dmg metigation can reduce the dmg of the TK nuke\n\nThats all, goodluck on beating kala\n",

I already forgot my email I used to my account since 2015 but I can still log it in for 2019, the reason I can still play it is because my account is saved on the web browser that I use. I stopped playing it when adobe flash player was ended and now I want to play aqw again. Thanks. :)\n",

            "text": "Players for a while have been wanting some depth to the gameplay in AQW, and the current game just offers two roles - support, and DPS, and that ensures you only ever need to have 4-5 classes that are the most usable in the game. A few for support, and the others for high DPS shenanigans. But, that leaves hundreds of classes in a useless state, and I understand that some classes are stepping stones to better ones, but hundreds of useless classes don't all serve that purpose, most of them are just useless.\n\nI feel like the sheer volume of classes in game limits their potential. A more interesting turn needs to be taken to breathe some life into the game. ***And to that end, since AE seems to be listening to their players seriously this month, I think it's time we from the community make it easier for them and provide them with ideas on how to make gameplay more interesting.***\n\n***For my contribution, this is what I propose. (This involves a lengthy setup and explanation, skip if you're not interested.)***\n\nThis is an idea inspired by the online MMO game, Dark Orbit, which isn't a great game to draw inspiration from in general since it has a history of not caring about its players, but nonetheless, here's my pitch.\n\nIn DarkOrbit, there are regular maps, and a set up special maps called Blacklight Maps, where the blacklight maps host a set of powerful foes that eclipse the enemies in the regular maps by huge margins. These enemies can be made easier to farm using special *blacklight* weapons that do more damage to them, and collecting more and more of these makes it easier to deal with them.\n\n***This is what I drew from the information I've provided.***\n\nWhat if AQW were to receive a Saga where the regular classes they use were very ineffective against enemies and the whole way we conduct combat needs to be changed?\n\n***Painting a picture through a story:***\n\nConsider this. A new army amassed by a mysterious force marches to Lore with intent to capture. Heroes of Lore gather to respond to the threat, and face off against a small fighting unit sent by their leader. As the fight begins, the heroes charge at the foes with every skill in their arsenal, but they don't even seem to be putting a dent on them. Defeated, Artix and his heroes retreat, leaving a few comrades behind, unable to save them. The mysterious force sets up camp in the outskirts of Lore, building their defenses in hero territory.\n\nQuest 1 Complete: Defeat Was Inevitable \n\nThe defeated heroes convene to discuss their future, and the best course of action to be taken against a foe much more powerful than themselves, or anything they could have ever imagined. The conversation turns bleaker by the minute, and just as hope dwindled, a mysterious figure appears from the shadows. \n\n\"With all your magic, skills and weapons, you won't faze this foe,\" the stranger explains. \"This is a foe beyond your world, protected by ***his*** aura. So long as his light shines upon them, they cannot be harmed by the best of you.\"\n\nThe heroes, weapons drawn, continue to humour the intruder - hoping to get some information from the exchange. \n\n\"I'm not your enemy. I'm a castaway - I do not serve him, I do not have his light. It is therefore in your best interest to listen to me, or you will be defeated by an enemy whose magic you don't comprehend. And trust me, it is in my best interests that you do beat ***him***. We have a common enemy - one that you cannot hope to beat without the help of my organisation - The Abyss.\"\n\n\n***Gameplay proposition for a potential new saga.***\n\nA new faction presents itself to us, one that promises ***hard-earned*** classes, ones that serve a very specific purpose, to do damage to the \"auras\" of this new class of enemies, without removing which, no normal class can do any substantial damage to them. These classes would ideally pair with normal classes to beat these foes, and when needed, stand on their own. This can also translate into some Legion, Nation, Good and Evil classes to get an upgraded Abyss version to help with this new challenge. \n\nA whole saga with gameplay that requires teamwork between Abyss and regular classes. One class does more damage to their aura, one does more damage to their HP. A Ying and Yang situation. \n\nThe Abyss classes' performance in regular combat I leave to the Devs. \n\n\n***That's my idea for one possible way to make gameplay a bit more multi dimensional and somewhat more interesting. Since AE are listening to feedback these days, I would like to encourage as many people as possible to present their ideas as well.***\n",

            "text": "I apologize for yet another calendar post, but here's some context: I quit AQW last year after AE promised to rework MindBreaker and going into standby mode for so long. Recently, I came across this sub once more, and to my surprise, not only several classes have been buffed, but also every player got a free chrono class! This made me really excited to get back into the game once more, but since I run on a budget, I want to make those 6 HP really count.\n\nIt has come to my attention that we now have a new endgame weapon (Apotheosis) and two ultra bosses to beat in order to get it. Regarding the chrono classes, I've considered getting either TimeKiller, CDK or SSOT, since these appeared to be the most popular chronos for the bosses... until the patch kicked in and nerfed several of those classes.\n\nI wish to get a chrono to fill some sort of nieche that no other class can fill, however I already own all non Heromart endgame classes in the game: VHL, Legion Revenant, YnR, LightCaster, Dragon of Time, StoneCrusher and Lord of Order. I also got Eternal Chronomancer as my single chrono via 6k ACs. So in this context, is there a chrono class that outperforms any of my classes in terms of soloing or farming? (I'm also aware that 2 chronos are still to be released soon this month) Thanks in advance.\n",

So to vent out my frustrations, here are the classes that works (and are important) while explaining why, in the Ultra Exaltia Bosses\n\n# Support\n\nSupport classes are often split into 2 things: **Healer** and **Damage**.\n\n* Legion Revenant (LR): **Damage** Support. This class provides High Damage Reduction to the enemy, and High Damage Increase to allies. High Range and AOE attacks while dealing decent damage. Provides a mediocre heal\n* Light Caster (LC): **Healer** and **Damage** Support. Provides mediocre attack and defense buff and decent Heal. Can deal high damage as well. Single Target close range\n* Stone Crusher (SC): **Damage** Support. Provides high defense and offense buffs and debuffs for DPS. Deals mediocre damage that increases with allies. Single Target Close Range\n* Archpaladin (AP): **Healer and Damage** Support. Mediocre defense and offense buff but provides very high heals. Deals mediocre damage (if stacked Commandments). AOE High Range attacks.\n* Lord of Order (LoO): **Damage** Support. Provides high defense and offense buffs and debuffs. Also has a weak heal (yes, weak) and mediocre damage. Unknown Range and Attack (I don't know anything about this class)\n* Frostval Barbarian (FB): **Damage** Support. Provides high yet consistent buffs and debuffs with a mediocre yet consistent heals. Low damage, Unknown Attack.\n\n# Damage Dealers\n\nLiterally anything that deals damage. One thing to note is that these damage dealers a should be ***FAST*** as slow nukers (Like SSoT) is just bad.\n\n* Void Highlord (VHL): High Damage, especially in longer fights. Very consistent on self-heals and damage while being Tanky enough to even solo the bosses. Close ranged Single target\n* Timekiller (TK), Chrono Corrupter (CC): ***Fast*** Nukers. While they can't one shot the bosses, they are exceptionally good in bursting down Engineer's Drones and Engineer himself. Corrupter has an RNG based Heal that can help it surive longer while TK is a rick man's YnR. Can also be used against Warden (but good luck not getting Petrified). **NEVER USE AGAINST EZRAJAL.** Close ranged Single target\n\nSo far that's all the Classes ***THAT I KNOW OF*** that works. The Meta for killing the bosses are mostly 4 Supports. But it can change with Warden and Engineer as they don't disrupt offensive capabilities (but deals high damage anyways). \n\n4 Supports, or 3 Supports 1 Fast Nuker.\n",

If Resplendent Aura is active, consumes  stacks of Recovery and massively heals the user. If Destructive Aura is  active, consumes stacks of Devastation and deals massive damage.**  It was basically either an Omega-heal or a big nuke depending on what mode you're using and was the best part about the class before it was Ulta Bugged ^(pun super-intended) and caused monsters to not-spawn/give drops if you nuke them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew UO 5 skill :  **With enough force, you strike your target hard enough to cause the aura  currently strengthening your weapon to temporarily switch effects. If  Resplendent Aura is active, increases outgoing damage by 30%. If  Destructive Aura is active, decreases incoming damage by 30%. Effect  lasts for 10 seconds.**  Now this is the new one, if you're going **Destruction** you get damage mitigation and if you're going **Resplendant** you get damage amplification.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my current issue is that this new 5th skill is a really bad skill where if you're going **Resplendant** your damage is increased (granted this also increases your HoT cuz of game mechanics) when i would think people going for **Resplendant** wouldn't enjoy more damage they would like to be tankier/healthier in their fights, and the opposite is true for **Destruction** where the damage amp or a nuke would make much more sense here rather than a 30% incoming damage decrease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Solutions available** : We can either bring back the old 5th skill if possible as maybe it was unsolvable before >!(even though it used to work perfectly but for some reason it started to act weird)!< or atleast swap both modes and make is Omni^((something other than reversal)) as the class feels extremely gimmicky and useless nowadays after it being the king of DPS at its older days.\n",

(If you get the voucher early, trade in for totem or farm tainted gems individually)\n\nDoing this route 15 times for the 15 required quest means 30 blood gems and 200 dark crystal shard (+ bonus totems), totally eliminating the need to those specific quest.\n",

AQW n\u00e3o tem moderador brasileiro que ajuda a seguran\u00e7a do jogo em si, s\u00f3 tem moderadores estrangeiros mas eles n\u00e3o falam da L\u00edngua Portuguesa ou L\u00edngua Espanhola, eu sempre senti exclu\u00edda sendo jogadora brasileira que jogava um jogo que s\u00f3 tem idioma Ingle,eu amo Ingles, sou apaixonada L\u00edngua Estrangeira eu fiz v\u00e1rias amizades dos jogadores mesmo falando um pouco de Ingles, alguns deles s\u00e3o brasileiros, os outros s\u00e3o do pessoal de Filipinas, eles foram muito simp\u00e1ticos e gentis comigo,  por\u00e9m n\u00e3o sou fluente na conversa inteira no Ingles \u00e9 muito complicado voce jogar outro jogo que n\u00e3o tem o seu idioma do pa\u00eds onde voce vive, principalmente pessoas que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o fluentes no Ingles eles falavam um pouco... \n\nN\u00e3o fa\u00e7o mais parte da comunidade da Alina e n\u00e3o sou simp da Alina por causa das mentiras da empresa AE quase 13 anos, estou cansada de ouvir isso tantas promessas vazias n\u00e3o colabora sequer investem o AQW ficam prometendo dos f\u00e3s com coisas que n\u00e3o v\u00e3o acontecer no futuro do AQW ou AQ3D,  Artix  e sua empresa sempre foram muitos ocupados  pois focavam muito no jogo AQ3D.

Cuts through high level mobs and bosses like butter and was able to reach rank 10 within a matter of minutes with a class boost\n\nMy only issue with the class so far is that I can't seem to sustain mana against low health mobs. Initially went with a combo of 4 > 3 > 2 > 5 as recommended. When that didn't work, I tried going with 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 to try cutting mana costs. While that worked out slightly better, I usually still run into mana issues after some time. Furthermore, the guaranteed crits from the 2 skill do not seem to increase mana at all\n\nMy current enhancements are full wiz + spiral carve. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong and can help me out? Thanks\n",

            "text": "**Hey guys, this method is my tried and true method. Both my main and my alt now have the hard to get badge.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pre-requisites (this is what I started off with before trying to farm the badge):**\n\n* 100 M Gold. \n* The necessary regents to move around the rooms in miltoniussecret i.e. acaras fang, a strand of vath's hair etc etc. \n* Doom matter x 30 / Chaoroot x 30 \n* 30 Dragon Runestones. \n\nAfter attaining the aforementioned things, you need to do the following:\n\n* Choose the dragon runestone option (it's the first one)\n* Thenn, choose the level that's  5-15 1000 rep\n* After that**,** choose chaoroot **THEN** doomatter **(it needs to be in that order)**\n* You will eventually run out of dragon runestones, **so buy two 500 k Gold vouchers and trade them for x10 Dragon runestones.** \n* Once you run out of the alchemical reagents, head to miltoniussecret and go to [swindle and bulk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=251Lsc7Xo0M).  Once in the merge shop, **there you can purchase the receipt of nulgath for  300 k and trade it for x10 of both Chaoroot and Doomatter**. Personally, I bought 6 then used three for each reagent so I had x30 each time. \n\nOn my main account, I spent most of the gold I had it had around 1.43 million gold left . However, when I did the same thing on my alt, I got the badge **\"*****quicker*****\"** and it had around 3.68 million gold left after the entire run through. \n\n**Extra pieces of information that may or may not be useful to you:** \n\n* There are a bunch of animations that can change during the heating of the dragonstone, the default one is in it's name but it can be either: Cysero, derp beleen, a sneevil passing gas or a blue Chinese dragon. \n* Lim also makes comments during random alchemical attempts: \" Hurry up already....\" and \" Now this is progress!.....\" \n* Both times I received the badge Lim had made one of the aforementioned comments. However, the animations of the heating of the Dragonstone's both times were the red dragon.\n\n**If anyone succeeds with my method please let me know below!**\n",

Additionally, the -15% Defense Decrease on Awe Blast seemed more useful than the increased Crit Rate on Spiral Carve since VHL's skills already automatically crit.\n\n\\*I'm not the best at using these classes nor do I claim to be; I just find it interesting to see how the newly buffed SWoT stacks up to VHL in Solo's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, it seems like SWoT is back in business.

Like I coulda spent my money on better things, y'know? But after watching JSH talk about P2W, I realized that that thought is a bit entitled. \n\nNow I think that it was money well spent. Of all the years of joy and entertainment this game brought me in my younger years, what's a few dollars to spare to give back to the AE team? (even after the plethora of dramas in the past) \n\nI'm just one person, never really got anywhere socially, so I couldn't even give the game a bit of publicity. Just enjoyed it for what the team releases every now and then (eeeven after what they did to drakath SMH). Right now, I've bought about 3mo membership just in time to get the upholder badge.\n\nTldr; spending money to support the game I've played for years is worth it. \nSorry for the bad English, this ain't planned or thought of ahead of time at all.

I realise that PvP is broken, with some classes, especially those with high dodge, stuns or mindless nukes beat every other class in the game. With Great Thief, CA, Lycan, TK, VHL and LR running the PvP meta, the object of PvP is no longer skill, but the class you have. \n\nTo curb that, we set some ground rules. Classes that are unreasonably effective at PvP were tossed down the drain, and we instead used classes there duels actually lasted more than a minute and required some running away, duping, and planning. PvP in AQW can often feel unfair when you're against a GT that stuns you before you get a shot off and use their speedy cycles to end you before the stun wears off. If you don't have the exact class that counters it, it's basically over. \n\nPvP as it stands is less about what you can do and more about what you can have the opponent not do. It's hardly a fair fight when the opponent is essentially tied to a tree, sentenced to take a beating. \n\nWith those constraints, we had fun, and beat each other - not through the unbalanced nature of our classes, or the boosted gear in our inventory, but through our vigorous finger tapping, and extensive room hopping. \n\nPvP is trash, but when everyone stands a good chance of winning if they apply their skills, the game is more fun for it. I for one will never to back to PvPing with randoms, and in my own opinion, neither should you. \n\nP.S., to whom it concerns, take that GT and lodge it where the sun don't shine.\n",

If your teammate is very dumb and think Dragon of Time or Blaze Binder will help you to kill those bosses, you are in problem. Especially if they hit the boss when they counterattack and die hundreds of times.  \n\n\nAnd the last problem is that they don't have a proper animation to indicate the counterattack. You don't know how long it lasts, when it ends, etc.\n",

Most of the comments were accusing him, or more like sus of him, because of the Eye Was There badge. He only owned like 2018 honorable badge, so it pretty makes sense to me why he's pretty sus. I followed the post because it got pretty juicy. There was this particular comment that explained why he shouldn't be having the said badge. The commenter went on with Char IDs, the date of the event and stuff. Then a mod replied with something like \"it could have been awarded accidentally after finishing the mythsong storyline\" before the post was taken down. \n\nMy question is with regards to the mod's reply since i got pretty curious about the case. Since the event was already done 11 years ago, aside from loading it through bot, can you actually get the badge by \"accident?\"\n",

But with the current state of AQW, I think that the need for solo carry classes is now a necessity. To add more content to the game, I believe that adding boss fights with unique mechanics (and super hard but not like that version of drakath that literally needed 6 pyromancers rotating for every one-shot) would be a great addition to the game. To avoid one shots from calendar classes, add a single damage cap (maybe 80k?) and give the bosses the ability to cast debuffs and buffs. Additionally, there could be mechanics given such as aggro rotation, switching, healing reductions, stuns, and other sorts of stuff that would be a great addition to the game! Afaik, one of the mechanics with the most potential is the skill of the Guardian class (or sentinel? I\u2019m sure its from the verification classes) to induce aggro on themselves. \n\nWith that, creating a solid boss/dungeon segment in AQW that would need a complete party would be really great! Set an automatic queueing system for it, if possible classify their desired roles (supports, healers, dps, tanks)\n",

I previously stood by the (**delusional**) belief that using bots was ruining the game and moreover, that I would be instantly banned once I had done so.  I always felt good at the fact that items that I always legitimately, farmed for items that were \"hard\" to farm.\n\n In all those years I had never once thought about each player's circumstance outside the game and how that can effect their in game experience. I've played AQW more than any other game, it's strange, it's been a massive part of my teenage life. I enjoyed logging on even when the game slowed down and player ship dropped drastically. AQW no matter how bad it got, used to be something I'd always be logged into because its something I've always been there for me.\n\nThis was until things got hard for me in real life. I got kicked out my house during the pandemic because I came out to my parents. I was lucky enough to have been paid up for a year and a half on my student accommodation and was additionally given extra time to stay due to my situation. Sorry, got a bit too real there, long story short, overall I had less time to play and therefore, less time to farm end game items as they require a massive commitment in real life.\n\nThe endgame items are not viable to be farmed by the casual and even those who play everyday (like me) especially since life can change in the blink of an eye. So yeah, I used Bots for the first time and honestly, it feels great to be able to have the chance to get end game items without spending hours and house at a time.\n\nImportant info : \n\n* I only use the auto bot attack to attack general mobs \n* I always join private rooms\n* I never use any other features\n",

I found this quest kinda annoying due to the drop rate of broken blades from legion fenrirs and also having to buy back tendurr constantly.\n\nBut today I tried the \u201cbloody chaos\u201d quest from swindle and I managed to get 21 blood gems in 1-2 hours (wasn\u2019t really keeping track of the time). If you get lucky, you\u2019ll find a couple of players farming the level 90 hydras in /hydrachallenge each of which drop a lot more hydra scales than the lower level hydras. Also, the escherion\u2019s helm and shattered blade drop rates are pretty good too. This quest also either drops 1 or 2 blood gems, which is an added bonus.\n\nOverall, I just found this quest way quicker and less tedious. Hope this helps\n",

            "text": "Apologies if this kind of guide is not acceptable, but I have reported this bug to Artix Entertainment so they are already aware.  \n\n\nIt is possible to break the maximum stack count on a resource. Exactly how this works is unknown, but can be recreated fairly easily.  \n\n\nIn order to break the maximum stack of an item, all you have to do is the following:  \n\\- Have a pre-farmed stack that is BELOW the item cap count, and place it into your bank.  \n\\- Farm out enough of this resource so that if accepted, the total count of the item would exceed said stack.  \n\\- Once you have farmed enough to your liking, simply click accept.  \n\\- You will be faced with an unholy amount of \"This item couldn't be accepted because of it existing in the bank\" (or whatever it says, you know the drill).  \n\\- Simply keep a BUNCH of these windows open.  \n\\- Pull the already farmed stack out into your inventory ensuring you are not at the full count.  \n\\- Click accept again.  \n\\- Profit  ???  \n\n\nI found this while farming for Legion Rev. I hadn't accepted any of the Empowered Essence, and figured why not as I don't have NSoD. It flung over 50 warnings at me, so while they were open, I pulled 9 of them out of my bank. As I'd farmed past the x50 stack, it accepted the entire stack and added it to my already existing 9. At first I didn't think anything of it, as I didn't know that 50 was the max. After wiki'ing it to find out how to do the NSoD, I noticed it said the maximum was 50, which I immediately thought \"Holy paladins, that's an exploit and a half\".  \n\n\nHave fun, and if you exploit this, that's on you. I won't be, probably a ban-able behaviour.\n",

            "text": "I see tons of people holding on to their HeroPoints to get CCM/UCM and whenever people ask what the best class or best soloer is, it's always CCM/UCM, often without any sort of real explanation. In fact, many people will also instantly say CCM > UCM with no explanation as well. Sometimes I honestly doubt some of the people responding have actually tried the classes. One the other end of the spectrum, the recommender could be a way above average class user that has sort of a warped perspective for the what the casual player would really be best suited for (no offense). \n\nAs someone who owns both class variants, I just want to clarify what it is and isn't good for. I'm by no means an expert and maybe I have some things wrong, but hear me out. CCM/UCM is undoubtedly a top tier soloer and potentially god tier DPS, but *only some of the time*. Like all chronos, it's actually still quite a niche class mainly suitable for certain types of bosses, even with all the different combos at your disposal. This is because to maximize DPS, it always required you to sacrifice tankiness and healing no matter the setup. And even if you do try to do a tank or dodgy setup, it's still nowhere near as effective as the likes of VHL or YNR for those purposes. For the most part, it's incapable/inefficient at farming anything that hits moderately to very hard. It's also not really the best choice for bosses with low-ish health (quite a bit lower than your expected nuke damage) since it takes time to set up the nuke, and the nuke can miss or not crit. \n\nNow, let me go into more detail about the main setups and you can decide for yourself if this is class you really want/need, and also if CCM is really the better choice than UCM for everyone.\n\nPower + Entropic (CCM): This is the most straightforward setup, basically just standard chrono gameplay, and it hits fairly hard. Problem is Entropic causes you to take 150% damage which can be an issue for soloing. I think some people recommend it for group fights, but the 3 second taunt pretty much screws you over against OHK bosses like Ultra Maladrite. And even with those drawbacks, the nuke isn't that amazing at all compared to other chronos if the goal is to 1-shot the boss. The fast cooldown on the nuke is an advantage but only if you have enough supports so you can nuke early. Going with the Ultra Maladrite example, I would stick with Immortal Chronomancer over CCM, and some of the other chronos are definitely also good enough to warrant not buying CCM.\n\nPower + Madness (UCM): This is probably the second most straightforward setup and produces very consistent results because it guarantees a crit nuke every time with no drawbacks. However, the long-term DPS is lackluster compared to other setups. It's mainly fantastic for consistently 1-shotting bosses with moderate HP (<200k, but really depends on boosts). For this specific purpose, the DPS can in fact blow VHL out of the water, and it's one of the main reasons why I would consider UCM over CCM. Keep in mind, most bosses in the game have moderate HP. \n\nTransience + Infinite (CCM): Most of videos of people showing off CCM are showing off this strat, but it's really not as good as it seems. Again, hear me out. The DPS is really nice, so if you know what you're doing, it's solid for beating up health sponges (which is sort of niche, and if you really want to do this Transcience + Inevitability is better?, and that's a UCM timepiece). However, the main reason to use it is to do \"Def Trans\" (Defensive Transcience), which is basically a dodgy strat that can also nuke. Problem is, it's incredibly finicky, will stress you out like nothing else, and isn't consistent plain and simple. All the vids showing off the fast nuke damage are honestly kind of misleading because they don't show how many tries it took and the outside prep time. For one thing, to get a gigantic nuke for any setup, you need to get lucky (Spiral Carves), and you'll notice the people usually choose a boss that allows them to get extra boosts (undead, dragonkin, Drakath, etc.).  But besides that, there's a couple reasons why Def Trans is just waaaaaaaay too technical for what it's worth, even if you know how to use it. First, you have to pre-stack on some random mobs so that you can have your dodge aura up and running, then immediately jump to the boss before it fades or die from your self-DoT. This can be massively inconvenient, and the whole process is just annoying because if you accidently die due to not being quick enough or mana issues, you have to re-apply your pots. Second issue is once you start the actual fight, you have to be on full alert since you can't let yourself die from your self-DoT. Problem is, the only way to heal removes your dodge aura, meaning you have to time it right after getting attacked and then immediately re-apply the dodge aura, all the while hoping you don't run into mana issues. I don't know about you, but I can't maintain this cancer gameplay for more than a couple minutes. But it shouldn't be a problem if you just nuke and then heal between repawns right? I mean, that would be ideal, but the problem is that the nuke is inconsistent, not nearly all bosses can even be 1-shotted without getting really lucky, and doing a nuke cycle itself is risking death because you can't heal while setting it up. Personally, I'm perfectly happy with my thief classes or finding a party to beat these types of bosses. Maybe I sound like an idiot saying that and maybe I'll get shit for it, but I'm under the impression that the average player wouldn't be able to pull off this strat either.\n\nTransience + Inevitability (UCM): This set up gives you a DoT nuke that grows with each cycle that also feeds into your rift record nuke, so the DPS is absolutely insane for really long fights, way better than VHL. It's really good, just that there are hardly any opportunities to do this type of fight unless you want to knock yourself out with the training dummy, and the problem with anything + Transience is that you run the risk of dying from self-DoT if you slip up or stop paying attention for a sec. \n\nPower + Inevitability (UCM): One of the best setups for DPS, honestly a lot better than Entropic in my experience and generally better than VHL. I'd say it's great for high but not ridiculously high HP bosses. A bit trickier than Entropic and takes longer for the initial setup, but not overly complicated, so still suitable for casual gameplay.\n\nPower + Infinite (CCM): Well rounded, very straightforward playstyle. Decent DPS and you get a small HoT. Sounds great on paper, but the tanking ability provided by that HoT is absolutely still laughable compared to VHL or LR, and VHL easily has better DPS. \n\nParadise (CCM) + whatever: Sort of sad attempt to make CCM tanky. It applies a bunch of defensive buffs but completely cripples your DPS. You are able to switch off the buffs to give you a window to nuke, but then you risk dying, so it's kind of just pointless. (UCM's Paradise used to be bugged, making it good with Madness, but that's no longer the case so it's basically irrelevant now.) Even with the buffs, it's no where close to VHL tankiness. \n\nPestilence (UCM) and Foresee (CCM) are mediocre and basically irrelevant.\n\nOverall cons: \n\n* You need to re-apply pots if you mess up and die. This is most annoying when using Transience, but Entropic and Pestilence also increase your chance of dying.\n* Sometimes pot cooldowns are bugged and you have to relog.\n* Basically forced to use Spiral Carve and only really works great with boosts and high level. \n* Most of the setups also require you to do a specific combo to initiate and then specific rotations for nuking, healing, and re-initializing. It's a shit ton to memorize for a casual player, even if you understand how everything works. Obviously, no button mashing. \n* You can't use regular pots (you can still use elixirs and tonics that last a long time though). This is actually kind of sucks because that means the other chronos and VHL, etc. can potentially have better DPS just by using a cheap Fel potion.\n\nBottom line: I don't consider CCM/UCM a staple for soloing like VHL. It's a really good chrono, but still a chrono nonetheless. For group fights, most of the time any other chrono is more than good enough if you already own one. Is CCM/UCM overrated? Maybe. Useless? Heck no, but you have to ask yourself what you want to do in this game. As for CCM vs. UCM?  Honestly, up to you. Entropic (CCM) and Infinite (CCM) are both sort of used for risky strats. UCM I feel is much more friendly for the casual player and arguably better for most purposes IMO. Hopefully this helps some people. If the class gets re-balanced with the release, then I guess then this post may be all for naught, but it is what it is.\n",

            "text": "So I was playing this game since 2009 when everything was really simple. I found the game was fun with the concept but it's missing item varieties at the time. I was bored and busy so I can't do the thing that is considered as a hard farm. I have created several accounts just to try some items because there was a free 500 ACs for new players.\n\nOn 2012 or so, I left the game to focus on my school. I don't have the time to play the game and collecting items in the game so I just left all my accounts. Something that I did wrong was not writing or saving the password of my accounts so I forgot all those. I forgor \ud83d\udc80\n\nThroughout the years, I keep getting updated about the game. I checked the design notes every 2 months or so. Then at some point of time, there was a feud with botters or something. There was something called bot or trainer. I was not interested because at the time I was not playing the game. \n\nThen lately, someone told me that some of the feature in the trainer is actually better than the original launcher. I'm aware that there's something called AQLite but I didn't give it a try yet. They told me that there's something called Cosmetic SWF, Modify Text, Modify Value, etc. I was interested so I give it a try.\n\nThe one that I downloaded was Cetera, by Spider the new dev I guess. It was really smooth and cool. I can open the bank everywhere, move cells anytime, customize the class' name to something funny, and a lot more. It was really fun. \n\nAfter trying Cetera, I started to play the game again with my new account. I was doing a lot of storylines. I got the Necromancer class, at the time without using the auto attacks. It took me so long to get Necromancer maybe because my lack of knowledge. Then I hear that Necromancer is far outdated. There is something called Void Highlord that is really hard to get and really OP. Then I see the requirements and the guide, I think to myself. I can't get all of these manually without sacrificing my productive hours, so maybe I should use the bot instead.\n\n(HERE'S THE MAIN POINT)\n\nLater, I decided to use the bot. I searched how do I set the bot up. I watched Operation Arclight and it's interesting how creative players are. It really saves my time and I feel relieved. I don't feel like I'm in the wrong because I'm ready for the consequences and I don't terrorize other players. Instead I'm helping them with farming together even though I'm not doing it manually. Also, I'm not hacking and ruining the game. I'm also just doing the regular botting things, not exploiting bugs or stuff. \n\nWhat makes me feel good is the fact that 50% of the players online are botters farming their items. So AE won't easily ban every single one of them because they are the ones that is keeping the game alive at the same time. They bought ACs and Membership like other players. So if AE decided to easily ban them, then the game will probably be dead. I also read that Alina at some point was thinking about making botting legal by adding some auto attacking feature in the game but I don't know.\n\nSo as long as I don't get reported, I'm fine. That's why most of the time I'm using private room so that no nerd will report me.\n\nNot that I advertise botting, I'm just trying to say you can play the game however you want as long as you can face the consequences. Don't complain when you're getting banned. I know this post will trigger a lot of squeaky swines of order but I am a fan of free will and free speech. Thank you!\n\nBATTLE ON!\n",

This boss is also so damn bullshit because you literally can't do anything if you don't use the 6 or so classes that can handle this boss.\n\nThe exaltia bosses were pretty much perfect in terms of difficulty, they were hard and required teamwork and proper team comp, but most importantly you had more class freedom. Then Batara Kala came where you need to stuff as much damage reduction and heals as possible to survive. And now this Ultra Avatar shit where you need to deepthroat him with even more damage reduction that can only be done by a couple classes, some of them member only and calendar classes.\n\nI knew they were going down this path, each boss being more bullshit than the other.\n\nKeep the daily farm for those who can and are willing to, but also give the others a way to grind for the items. Something that involves the normal variant of the boss and a bunch of minion killing and other things. Some days i'm willing to play more AQW but having nothing else to do except lose my mind with randoms just makes me quit the game.\n",

            "text": "Hello everyone, wiki mod DFK here. I usually lurk this sub but I've been seeing more questions and concerns about the wiki's search, so I hope to address some things. I'll also give an update on some new things we've done\n\n**No Search Results**  \nThe tldr on this is: wikidot is an old website and has problems. I really wish I could give you a solid answer, but this isn't something we can directly fix. I've tried a few things in Google Search Console but have been waiting a handful of weeks for an update on that. If you're wondering why stuff isn't appearing in google searches, simply put it's because when google was last indexing pages a lot of them failed to load.  \nWhat I can tell you is that google searches should work for roughly 50% of pages, so it might be worth a shot if you're looking for something old you don't exactly remember the name of.\n\n**New Searching**  \nTo combat this, I've added a direct search to the [Search](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/search:main) pages. If you know the exact name of what you're looking for, this should help you out quite a bit. If you use the Vivaldi browser, you can set the search box as a custom search engine which might make your life even easier.  \nKeep in mind that we name Location pages after how they appear on maps and not their /join name. **But**, I soon plan on indexing all the locations and adding a search bar where you can type the /join mapname and it will take you to the location page, so look out for that.\n\n**New Updates**\n* If you ever view the [Homepage](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/main) of the wiki, you will very likely have noticed that it has a much different look. I tried to make it a little more modern and appealing, reducing the amount of text and making it more visual. It also should be a little easier to use on mobile. I also tried to add some more important buttons front and center, such as New Releases and Search Items by Tag.\n* Yesterday I also updated [Search Items by Tag](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/search-items-by-tag). I also cleaned up the look of it, and by popular (like 2 people) request, you switch to showing the Female armours instead of Male. Under Top Tags I also added some shortcut buttons: Available (adds \"-rare -pseudo-rare -seasonal\") and Weapons (adds \"bow mace sword etc\").\n\nThat's all for now. Next on my list is the redo the navbar since it's pretty clunky and pretty useless on mobile. [Here's](https://imgur.com/KCp9Xmz) a sneak peak of how the navbar will look on mobile. It maybe needs a few tweaks, and we'll need to redo the site banner first, but that should be soon.\n\nIf anyone has any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear it. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading.\n",

            "text": "Hi everyone I just wanted to share how I got my first kill today against this boss. \n\nWe used Archpaladin, Naval Commander, Lord of Order and Legion Revenant. In our experience the Archpaladin will do the heavy lifting here (if you could call it that):\n\n* After the party buffs up the Archpaladin must go in before the others and start casting his 3rd and first abilities, this is done to avoid having the others getting one shot and having to reset the fight. \n* The Archpaladin should keep spamming his first and his 3rd ability and only use his second ability (heal) if he or the naval commander goes below \\~2.5k HP. \n* The other part members should just spam their abilities, Archpaladin must never use his 4th ability.\n* kill priority should be : focus Orb 1>focus Orb 2>attack boss.\n* if an orb respawn you should ignore the boss and focus on killing the orb as fast as possible.\n* If your class's auto attack is melee range then you should go near the orb that you want to attack to deal as much damage as possible. Don't just stand at the entrance, the boss and the orbs will attack you anyway.\n\nIn our experience the orbs where spawning so fast that we spent the whole fight going from one orb to the other. I think the respawn time on orbs is bugged and should be longer but don't panic if this happens, the boss will die eventually due to the AoE damage he is taking from all your abilities. Took us about 2-3minutes to kill the boss.\n\nPotions are not needed, we did the fight without using them. But they can be very useful to make the fight easier or faster depending on what potion you decide to use.\n\nWhy that Classes combo? Well NC can taunt and get more powerful in party, LoO has all of the buffs, AP is a Well rounded with powerful debuffs and aoe heal and LR is mainly for aoe dps and its buffs/debuffs. Other classes combos that have similar strengths may work.\n\nI hope you find this helpful and good luck!\n",

After a week of trying to get my account recovered from Artix Support, I finally logged in to only feel happy and sad about the good old, easy times of life when I first played it. It's been 12 years since I had logged in. I can't believe how detailed and crazy the armor and weapons are now compared to what I have in my inventory! It's like comparing 720P to 4K \ud83d\ude02 I was actually surprised this game was still active after all these years and how the general gaming community is evolving each year. None the less, I was happy to log on, briefly explore and interact with players and see how much the game has changed, eg having Ioda (which I'm sad about now that some of my items don't hold the same rarity value) but it's still all good! It wasn't until I actually came across a friend I played with back in 2009 by pure chance! He caught me up with the know how and what items to buy back which was a lot of fun. It was wild and I had a really good time. I remembered why I was so obsessed with the game.\n\n\nNow, I'm wondering, are there any OG's from 08 to 10 that still play? I'd love to know if I remember you or not! I mainly potted around B-1 or Y-1 in Sir Vir.\n\n\nLet me know!\n",

I experienced alot of it :)\n\nbecause of those problems want to sharing to you about how to using the classes there. \n\nYou dont need using any potion if you are good to using your classes. I never using pot to killing that boss until now. But if you wanted using it, it totally your choices\\^\\^. I killing that boss many times. Because i have multiple accounts. SO i learning alot from it.\n\nSo this is some game play i use while against Ultra Tyndarius. Mostly class used there are 3 supports with one taunt class. Taunt class is class which provoke the targets to attack the users. \n\nThis is the composition class which is needed to killing that Ultra Tyndarius. for the Support class we have : Archpaladin (AP), Lord of Order (LOO), Legion Revenant (LR). And the Taunt classes we need there is \\*these class are optional\\* Naval Commander (NC), DKL (Dark Knight Lord), Ch Cmd (Chrono Commandant), SSOT/SWOT (Shadow Stalker/walker/weaver of Time) and DSG (Dragon Slayer General).\n\nI cant't sharing all of it because of my limitation. I dont have Ch Cmd and DSG (because i removing it long time ago) or im bad when using DKL (i died alot and cant find the way to using it properly) or SSOT/SWOT (riskful and a bit complicated when we want to using it in this battle). So i will use the other classes i can use for the goodness\\^\\^\n\nThis is my game play while i againt that ultra tyndarius using my AP, LOO, LR or NC which i want to you guys to know it. I hope it help u or your party against that boss!.\n\n1. Play style of Archpaladin : This class now is common to use right now. But for using it you must know to maximize it. This class bassically the angel who protecting the party. Because it make the party alive and safe. The party will safe if you have enough stacking of your 2nd skill and reducing the damage your party get with your 4th skill. When the stack is maxed your party will alive. for game play you must using your 3rd skill before entering the boos room. then using the combo 4-2-3-2-2-4 (Using 2nd and 4th skill. Especially the 4th skill as soon as possible when it unlocked to make stong debuff and reducing the incoming damage to your party.). \\*You can use this class againt both orbs or ultra tyndarius depend on how your party play style.\\* The main idea using this class is get your 2nd stacks as soon as possible and keep reducing damage with your 4th skill\n2. Play style of Lord of Order : This class also common used in this ultra boss. This is knight of that party which face the boss without fear. This class has strong and useful buffs. Using 2nd skill to increasing the party stat and 3 to reduing the damage you got before you enter. For game play i suggest fight the boss only. \\*It can changed to your party play style.\\* after you in, you can use this combo 5-4-2-4-2-5 and 3 sometimes when u need or your party need some health. The main idea using this class is stacking the 5th skill for reducing the damage to target and applying mirror ability to the target after few times and using 4th skill to boost your ally haste, hit chance, etc and 2nd skill to boost your party stats. You can reading aqwwiki to more detailed info.\n3. Play style of Legion Revenant : This class is great. It can do the jobs the owners have. This class is the helper to the party. For using this class is'nt that hard. You have to buff your party with your 4th skill. Then using 2-3-5. The main idea using this class is using your 3rd skill or the 4th skill when it unlocked to apply debuff and apply some buffs. Then you can apply 2nd skill to decrease the dodge for the enemy and 5th skill to cut your mana consume.\n4. Play style of Naval Commander : This class is the hero of the party (all taunt classes does). They are willing to attacked for the party sake. They are crucial so keep them alive. Because in my experience when i died using my NC, all party also died. Using taunt class is scarry if you not used with it. But its fun if you know how to using this class. For using this class you can use 4th skill first. then 2-4-5-2-4-3. Then repeat 4-2-4-5-2-4-3.\n\nYou guys can sharing your game play in here.  Feel Free to do!.\n\nThanks for reading and participating in my post\\^\\^\n\nCorrect me if im wrong!\\^\\^\n",

Seemed powerful when I was leveling it in ice storm arena \n\nBut now that I\u2019m actually using it to farm the 5 undead dracolich I gotta say it\u2019s pretty underwhelming. It\u2019s not the worst class but it\u2019s definitely not really good at all.\n\nCons\nIt has low survivability. You apply a stacking dot to yourself which cancels out your auto heal and can one shot you if your not constantly monitoring the stacks.\n\nAll skills only hit 3 targets. \n\nSuper laggy animations. I\u2019m playing on a rtx3070 and have to disable my animations cause your auto attacks have a massive animation that appears over all 3 enemies and with your haste buffed it gets very messy. \n\nWeak heal. Your auto heal on auto attacks is good but like I said it cancels out pretty quickly and your 5th skill which is the other heal is bogus. It also has a 1 second lag before it procs which can be critical and cost you your life.\n\nAlso I can\u2019t solo farm the 5 headed undead dragon but maybe I\u2019m using the class wrong? You have to stack a massive dot on yourself  before you can use your heal which is so counterintuitive and the heal isn\u2019t even good.\n\nPros are it hits fast I guess? Lol it has Good damage. Your 4th skill is the hard hitter and I hit about 5-8k with it on 3 targets. 10 second cool down though which sucks.\n",

            "text": " Hello, fellow AQW players - but especially to any of my AQW role-players who may be lingering out there like lost lambs searching for a home. Looking for an official place to belong to the AQW community as an AQW role player? Well, keep reading (and don\u2019t skip any lines\u2026):\n\nMy recent story begins the day I logged back into AQW after SO MANY years of inactivity. Of course, I did the thing that\u2019s most popular to do and resumed grinding at rep I still needed, slaved for new classes that I missed the release for, caught up on many of the events/stories, and etc...ya know, typical PVE stuff (and as for PVP, well, I don\u2019t even touch that in this game lol). But, I\u2019m a true blue RPer at heart, and after so many days of just sitting at my desk for several hours on end hitting stuff with the same five buttons, it gets *b o r i n g*. Don\u2019t get me wrong. AE tells fun and entertaining stories that still crack me up. However, what I truly desire is a good, strong RP presence in the AQW community, for the people that are overlooked in that aspect of the game; You know, the \u201cRP\u201d that\u2019s in MMO**RP**G. We RPers are players too; we just enjoy being creative with our gameplay in addition to being engaged in the fun-loving content that is AE\u2019s specialty. \n\nAnd considering the game\u2019s history and collective lore altogether, it certainly has the potential to make for some amazing and interesting role-playing themes! Heck, there are even parodies for those RPers with an even greater funny bone. Anywho, I say all this because I would like to present a shiny, new discord server that\u2019s primarily focused on (you guessed it) ***role-playing in AQW***! This is a special hub I\u2019ve created for **all** AQW players, but with extra love for those who role-play (noobs & veterans)! I\u2019ll drop the discord link at the end of this post.\n\nThough functional, the server is currently in the BETA phase, and as such, I will be dishing out special, *limited-time-only* tags to newcomers. Hopefully, it makes the game even more addictive than it already is. \n\nThat being said, \n\n**Battleon** & ***RP-on!*** \n\nP.S. Thoughts and questions concerning AQW RP are encouraged and welcome in this discussion, as I\u2019m curious to know how many of my fellow AQW role-players are out there (and of those who are interested in learning more about it). Also, here\u2019s an infinite link to the Discord server: [AQW RP Hub](https://discord.gg/tn93x5NgwS)\n",

I've been on the slow grind for VHL for a long time but I burn out. The sheer amount of option is a bit overwhelming in regards to the new chrono classes and from what I've gathered from the threads I've read, there isn't one class that's better than the rest, they all serve their own purpose. I also noticed Great Thief is in the shop with the other classes. Is that any decent? I haven't seen it mentioned in any of the chrono class threads yet.\n",

            "text": "**Pre-warning, there are spoilers for the event in this post. I do not have the updated version of reddit, thus am not able to tag a post as a spoiler post.**  \n  \n\n**Section 1:**\n\nSo, we start our story by receiving a letter from an unnamed pedestrian of Eridani Village to come and investigate multiple murders that have been going on in the village as of late.  \n\n\nOnce we arrive, we are met by a strange figure named 'Re' that accuses of the murders we have been asked to investigate. Reluctantly, we deny her accusations and discover that the unnamed pedestrian that sent us the letter died the day prior and Re proves this by showing us his skull.  \n\nShe then proceeds to inform us about the situation we are in;  \nEridani is a village in a constant state of time, meaning it never progresses and repeats the same day over and over while life progresses as normal in the real world. The cause of this shift is due to a giant blood moon in the sky that slowly drives people insane, but more importantly, fearful.  \n\nRe claims to have seen mysterious creatures around the village attacking the villagers and possibly infecting them, so, we investigate the village and ask around for clues.  \n\n\n**Section 2:*  \n\nThe first villager we speak to is 'Bursha Night', a worried mother that informs us that there have been multiple murders as of late, one of which she speculates to be her son that has recently gone missing around the graveyard.  \nWe arrive at the graveyard and meet 'Caden Night', Bursha's son. Bursha states that he left the village five years ago and was surprised that his mother remembered him, having found a new adoptive family and dreaming of seeing her again.  \n\nWhat Bursha says further confirms that the village is in a constant time state as he claims to be missing for over five years, but, on the other hand, his mother claims that he only wandered off a couple of days ago.  \n\n\nOnce we're done, we return to the village and speak to Bursha, telling her that her son is fine, to which she responds by telling us that the village isn't safe for him to return to and that she is scared.  \n\nShe then recommends us to talk to another villager by the name of 'Loshe Allen' for more information.  \n\n\nLoshe brings up that the villagers constantly has drama between each other and always spark controversy, stating that Bursha kicked her son out and had an affair with the local Miller, later revealing the miller to have been killed.  \n\nLoshe also claims that the miller's daughter could be the culprit for his death as she is known to not be able to control her anger and to want a lot of attention, due to the miller's affair with Bursha, she hasn't been getting that, and could be jealous.  \n\nThis constant state of arguing and disagreement within the village is important for later.  \n\nAfter this information from Loshe is collected, we go to the mill for further investigations and find the miller's daughter, 'Bydis Miller' who is overwhelmed with joy that someone has visited her, stating that she cannot survive by herself now that her father is gone and that she misses him dearly.  \n\nBydis claims that her father would often give homeless people in the village bread, though the reason none are present anymore is because of the recent murders, they have all been executed on suspicion, aside from one man.  \n\nBydis says that this old man directed her father into a specific, unknown location that nobody has heard of before and accuses him of being his murderer.  \n\n\nWith this accusation in mind, we make our way to the town square and find the homeless man, 'Christopher Lugha', Christopher was a knight for the king, of which we don't know the name, but was betrayed and throwing into Eridani Village without a home. He tells us about the amount of executions that he's witnessed and how the town are always turning on themselves and killing each other on suspicion of murder.  \n\nChristopher tells us where he sent Bydis' father to, and we follow the directions into a house on the outskirts of the village. \nOnce there, we open the door and find the body of the dead father. \nBydis storms in behind us and suspects us of murdering him, calling all the townsfolk and demanding we are lynched.  \n\n\nThe townsfolk surround us and pause. After an instant, they begin exploding into gigantic, mutants, all sharing the same mark.  \n\nIt turns out that the infection Re warned us about is real and was waiting for a catalyst to be unleashed.  \n\nIt is later revealed that the infection is spread through negativity and fear, but does not have time to spread as time is in a constant state in this area. With the presence of an outsider (us) time as resumed and the infection just needs one more instance of fear before it is able to spread, which is the significance of the miller's death.  \n\n\nThe town is now completely full with mutated townsfolk, destroying everything and killing everyone else. Bursha, Loshe, Bydis and Christopher have all been converted into mutated freak versions of themselves and must be killed to move on.  \n\nWe report back to Re and she tells us that there is a creature living inside one of the houses that is controlling the town called the Mayor, she comes with us to destroy it, and once he is defeated, Re informs us that the the king wants to see us immediately, and we are arrested by royal guards to be taken into Astravia.  \n\n\n**Section 3:**  \n\nIn the king's menagerie, we are introduced to King Drago and his Assistant.  \nThe king claims to be the protector of Astravia and has us reinforce the castle's border from invaders and monsters to protect those inside.  \n\n\nWe go down to Astravia and are met by a retired mercenary named 'Kasper Garretts', he tells us that the people of Astravia have to fight the monsters themselves and have no help from the king along with threats by the king himself to kill anyone to speaks up about him, so all conversation must be done in secret.  \n\nWe then go around Astravia to gather information from people privately.  \n\n\nFirstly, we find night guard 'Carlton Magnus' that unveils an ancient prophecy that a legendary Star, Alprecha, descended upon Astravia, providing the people with a king and queen, marking them as their children. The people of Astravia promised to to praise the royal family in return for care and protection from them.  \n\n> Any harm that befalls the Ruler will be redirected to their subjects.  \n\nHe continues, saying King Drago abuses this blessing and kills multiple innocent civilians a day due to his blessing.  \n\n\nNext, we find doctor 'Rosa Anne Pechora', who shares the success of the king's army. Or rather, the lack of army, as King Drago would summon gigantic beasts for fight his battles with arms, legs and bodies of multiple people, one so big, it's heads brushed the sky and painted it red, forming the blood moon.  \n\n\nAfter acquiring more information about the king, rumour spreads of appraisal in our name and acts of kindness towards us. This same rumour is received by King Drago in which he is filled with rage, and forms a plan to get rid of not only us, but all the citizens of Astravia for disobeying his rule.  \n\nDuring this heated rant, the king's assistant suggests him to take action, and begin a demonic ritual known as \"The Coronation of the Celestial\" which is a ritual passed through the royal family to unleash devilish monsters that fought in the war long ago. \n\nThe ritual requires many sacrifices to take place in order to summon these beasts, though the king is persuaded and agrees to sacrifice all those who praise us and continues to perform the ritual.  \n\n\n**Section 4:**  \n\nBad news of the ritual spreads and Kasper reports to us that a letter is sent by King Drago to kill the invader commander and bring him to the throne, so we set off to do exactly that.  \n\nFar away from Castle Astravia, we seek out to destroy the invader's commander. We find him and the battle is close, then a bright green bolt is fired from offscreen and the invader commander is defeated. The figure reveals themselves to be La, and the commander Ti.  \n\nHere, it is revealed that La, Re, Ti and an unknown member by the name of So are members of the Scale, a group that is summoned once the right melody is played by a conductor. Ti reports that they all work for the same master, but La has gone 'rogue' and resorts to stopping the others of the scale to aid us.  \n\nBefore anymore clarification can occur, a giant explosion is seen in Castle Astravia and we immediately report back to the king to see what's happened.  \n\nOnce at the Astravia, there are no more citizens in the streets, but the sky is more blood red than before. Making our way through the city, we are confronted by the result of King Drago's ritual, a giant beast dubbed 'The Moon' in which we defeat.  \n\nAfter defeating The Moon, King Drago and his assistant rush down to see their failure and are furious. Drago is speechless but his assistant is revealed to be another member of the Scale called So, in which she threatens to kill us, if not confronted by La and told to calm herself.  \n\nThen, it is revealed that the Scale has a master called 'Darkon', whom they are helping take over Astravia. They let us escape and we take King Drago to his menagerie.  \n\nAfter leaving, So converses with La, stating they she has served the conductor (Darkon) since the beginning of their summoning, but the Darkon prior was slain and that So wishes to bring justice for his name.  \n\nHere, it is revealed that So has an ulterior motive as La responds by saying that if So helps present Darkon, she expects a wish to be granted, however, it is also revealed that Darkon wants to wipe out the entirety of the Capital (Castle Astravia and it's surroundings) and would not care to repay her.  \n\n\n**Section 5:**  \n\nWe arrive at the menagerie and King Drago continues to insult us, asking questions of what we are and why we're here. Out of rage, we attempt to kill him, but the gift of Alprecha is shown and, instead, one of his nearby guards is killed instead.  \n\nKing Drago reveals that he has a plan to sacrifice more civilians this way in order to summon another celestial beast dubbed \"My Sun\".  \n\nThe king then demands us to escort him out of the castle, as Darkon seeks revenge for what he's done. He sends us around the castle, looking for keys to escape.  \n\nMeanwhile, we see Darkon and all of the members of the Scale outside of the castle, plotting.  \nThere, So reveals to Darkon that La is a traitor and should be taken care of, to which Darkon smiles and disregards this accusation, stating that La is his closest follower, and has her own way of helping.  \nTi tells us that La has no intention of harming anyone other than King Drago, thus the members of the Scale, and Darkon do the same deeming her and us as not a threat.    \n\nWe're also introduced to Fa and Mi, leaving Do as the remaining Scale to not be heard from yet.  \n\nDarkon also says that we are in danger if left alone with King Drago and will rescue us from him, wanting to confront him.  \n\nOnce we finally get the key for King Drago, it is revealed that the key is not for escaping at all, but for a room filled with a ritual of the Coronation of the Celestial, to summon \"The Moon\".  \n\n\n**Section 6:**  \n\nWe chase King Drago into the room after getting a key of our own and dealing with his guards, to enter the hallway and be confronted by Darkon.  \nIn the hallway, he fight and lose to Darkon, but he has no intention of harming us, and instead helps us get to Drago.  \nOnce we're there, it is revealed that Drago is the younger brother of Darkon, who has not aged, as in his realm, time is constant **(sound familiar?)**  \nDarkon confronts Drago but he is too late as Drago sacrifices the last two needed people to summon The Sun and we are left with an ultimatum by Darkon:  \n\n> What do you plan to do, [hero]? Help Drago and the Sun defeat me? \n> Or will you help destroy this mass of sacrifices?  \n\nIn which we agree to help Darkon and defeat The Sun.  \n\n\nAfter defeating The Sun, Darkon grabs Drago and reveals his plan.  \nDarkon's plan was to have Drago summon all celestial beasts in order to summon the final, most powerful one yet, \"Judgement\".  \nDarkon also reveals that he has been the one controlling the infection and the invasions on the city.  \n\nDrago states that there aren't any more living people in Astravia to summon Judgement and all of Darkon's attempts would be futile.  \nHowever, Darkon does not plan to sacrifice living people, but instead sacrifices all the people he has infected as they were technically citizens of Astravia at some point along with all infected members of Eridani village.  \n\nDarkon also reveals how the infection has spread;  \nIt is a from another dimension, the same one Darkon is from, that burrows itself inside mortals with weakened minds in which they grow, feeding on paranoia and fear until they are big enough to use their human as a shell and mutate.  \n\nDue to the the seed being from a dimension in a constant time state, they had not had any time to mutate, however, due to our arrival, time had resumed, thus allowing them to grow. **(referring back to the villagers of Eridani)**  \n\nFinally, Darkon finishes by summoning Primordial Judgement, and creating a one-sided war between his army, and Astravia.  \n\n\n**THE END**  \n*As of 28/08/2021*  \n\n*If I've got something wrong, or have missed something vital, be sure to comment and tell me what it is, I've never posted to r/AQW and I'm not a master when it comes to Lore.*  \n\n*Whether this post will be updated as the event progresses is debatable, but a comprehensive story of Astravia would be nice to have somewhere, so I'll think about it.*  \n\n*ALSO, I suck at making reddit posts, so any formatting help would be nice.*\n",

            "text": "This is just an opinion I have but I wanted to put it out there to people to read and it they feel like it comment on it.\n\nAs the title says I think right now AQWorlds is at the best it has been since Chaos Finale put an end at the 13 Lords of Chaos saga.\n\nStory wise after the chaos saga we got the Queen of Monsters and the thing with the Celestials both of witch never truly felt like a treath. At first I discarted Malgor and the shadowfire as another edgy evil faction and while I still have some doubts about the shadowfire (Black with white dots looks ugly fight me) but Malgor himself as become a credible threat and I like that. The last update even got us fighting alongside Galanoth against a Fire-avatar-powered Tyndarius and managed to make \"fighting an elemental avatar\" believable thanks to the ultra fight being as hard as it is. And as the fight comes to an end Malgor is like \"Fuck this\" leaves his ELEMENTAL AVATAR TIER LACKEY to die and grabs a hold of the Mana Core. And at that point I realized that **OH BOY WE HAVE PROBLEMS.**  \nAnd don't make me get stated on Darkon  and Astravia. I love both the story and the aesthetics. A conflict with no right answers. Often we face enemies that have destroyed a town or a kindom, maybe we hear that they have killed people and we may see some skeletons here and there but thats it. **Not here, oh no**. You complete a quest and at the next moment all the rebels are replaced by a thin red fog, mutant creatures barely resembling humans (despite the fact they keep the \"HUMAN\" tag. Brutal.) and literal rivers of blood.\n\nGameplay wise I think the team has been doing a great job with the Ultra bosses recently. I mean, not like I have killed them and got the gear, nono, I tried some of them and came to te conclusion I am too much of a casual for that.  But I can see all the movement they generate, people looking for partys and trying diferent team comps, asking for recomendations on enhancements and potion buffs. Sure, they also rant a lot but if I know something about tryharders from other games is that they like to rant and it makes them feel that much better when they actually defeat the boss.  \nAQLite being made official and with spider now working for AE the game has seem QoL improvements at levels I have never seen before. I could make a whole another post on that so I will just leave it at this: Lord bless Freeze Monsters.\n\nI wanted to get all of this out of myself and put it out somewhere so here it is. I know the game still has a lot of problems, like afks on ultrabosses, and that there are some controversial topics out there like IoDAs and the chronoclasses but I find the fact that the game is still being updated after all this time and at such lever of quality as we have had recently truly a marvel and something to be grateful of.\n\nAlso English is not my first language and I dont have the time to doble-triple check all this text so if something doesn't make sence... try and make sence of it anyway.\n",

            "text": "As of currently I got my friend into AQW and he has taken an approach on whaling hundreds of dollars into the game while simultaneously botting and almost never being present. He\u2019s using a bot to farm on Sir Ver, wich is a low pop server, and knowing that I don\u2019t have member, he\u2019s sitting there laughing at me that nobody can touch him. And it pisses me off. Mainly because I can\u2019t report him from an other server. He\u2019s botted almost from 0-100 in a few days without logging off, and is making fun of AQW lack of moderators on low pop servers.\n\nSo I am wondering, if there is another feature as to where I could report him and a mod coming to check up on him, maybe player support of some sort or whatever. He has told me he\u2019s using a bot that click\u2019s one of his abilities to kill mobs while not even sitting at his pc.\n\nOfc, these are just my claims, and a moderator could go see him and tell just by looking at him or interacting with him that he\u2019s not present and is spamming one ability mindlessly to afk farm xp. Or even check his online time in the past few days, there\u2019s no way a mere human can go days without a break.\n\nBut then again botting is a big problem of aqw, and I understand if I get hate for this, I just can\u2019t stand botters running freely and having a laugh on how pathetic the game is, when there are \u201cmoderators that are moderating 7 days a week\u201d.\n",

Instantly I get bombarded by people begging Alina to make it a \"rare upgrade package\". I mean, really? Like really really? It seems as though all people on Twitter actually care about is collecting a bunch of rare items so they can flaunt off to other players how cool they are because they have a few rare items, all the while chilling in Yulgar doing absolutely nothing. Personally, to me it doesn't matter if an item is rare or not; good art is good art and if there's something I like, I'll equip it whether it's rare or not.\n\n\nI just don't understand why AE even pays attention to all those goofballs on Twitter.

They've already sort of done this with classes and armors, since armors are wholly cosmetic, but it'd be cool to see this done with weapons, helms, capes and even pets, too.\n\nIt's not exactly a revolutionary thought or anything, but what I'd like to see is a proper equipment screen displaying two different slots for every type of equipment; functional slots and cosmetic slots.\n\nFunctional slots would work exactly as equipping an item does in the game now; equipping an item here will confer to the player the stats, boosts and the damage range (for weapons) associated with the item. If nothing is equipped in the cosmetic slot, the item will also visually appear on the player. The cosmetic slot, on the other hand, is fully visual: equipping an item to the cosmetic slot will have no effect on stats, nor will it provide any boosts.\n\nThe reason I'd personally like this is because I have a lot of different sets for the different classes I play, and I'd actually like to be able to look good when farming rather than having to look at gear like the NSOD or the Awescended gear the whole time. With all these fashion items in the game, it's be a shame that you can only look good when you're AFK'ing in Yulgar.\n",

(Unless boss have a skill that reduce hit chance)\n* Since \\[4\\] gives us extra 30% Haste (regardless if it's additive or multiplied) so we've 50% Haste (capped) which means the cooldown of auto-attacks and skills is reduced to half the actual amount.\n* Critical Chance is 43.16% (31.85% if multiplied) which is the main problem of this class, if the boss is low leveled, this chance increases and you do more crits but if the ultra boss if a Lv100 boss, you're more likely to get 95k\\~110k non-criting hits which is kinda annoying.\n* Evasion Chance is 46.32% (31.85% if multiplied) which makes this combo not suitable for OHKO ulta bosses and that's why we use different combos in these situations.\n\nTL;DR so far, Power + Entropic is used against bosses who are above 45k HP that don't OHKO you, it can deal up to 1m damage on crits, and the combo full rotation takes around 15\\~21secs.\n\n*Can someone tell me how to calculate stats here, are passives additive stats and skills stats are multiplied modifiers or what?*\n",

However, I don\u2019t have hours and hours spare every day to play and grind out real end game items.\n\nI really want to experience the end game items such as SDKA, NSoD, VHL and LR but I simply don\u2019t have the time to grind for it anymore as it would take literally months to even scratch the surface of them.\n\nIs it really shameful to IoDA these items? I\u2019m really stuck and don\u2019t want to just be one of those \u201cPay to Win\u201d kind of people I\u2019m just going about my way of enjoying the game. What are you guys opinions on this matter?\n\nSorry for the long post don\u2019t hate me please, thankyou. :)\n",

I already have Immortal/Eternal Chronomancer, but I was thinking about SSoT or Nechronomancer.\n\nI know I can get an IoDA buying 40K ACs, but it's pretty expensive here. I live in a underdeveloped country and the currency is suffering from depreciacion. But I want to hear y'll opinions about it.\n",

I cannot Confirm my email, I cannot change my email, nothing... (I've made sure the mail properly works, and have checked the spam/junk folder, basically have checked all of those simple solutions). Now I've been going back and forth with Artix for a few days now, but God damn they are really unhelpful, they asked me to provide a lot of information about my account, so I did, I gave them so much info on my account, I cannot imagine how on earth would they have any problems with locating it or whatever, BUT it's still not enough, now they want me to give them \n\n* Information for the purchases made to this account \u2013 any transaction ID numbers, buyer names, buyer emails\n\nDoes anybody knows what this means? I've told them what my past purchases were and when I boughed them, but I don't get it what I'm I supposed to send them now? \n\nAny help will be much appreciated.\n",

Are the requirements too difficult for the rewards? I just think of it as a 'reward' for endgame players. Pure botters won't be able to get this item due to the Ultra Boss requirements, and people in guilds who make easy work of Ultra Bosses will still have to get the grind items. I don't want the bonuses to be too absurd either. 60% bonus damage is too high and 50% is lower than NSOD. No more than 50% bonus Gold, Rep, and CP because I don't want this to be an item that lets endgame players get everything for free, this is just something that lets you enjoy Fashion Quest Worlds without having to item-switch so much. This will be the only item that gives 50% bonus gold because at this point, gold is probably not very useful anymore, but it means you can spend and experiment with potions/spells/enhancements more while maintaining gold easier. (No bonus XP because Awescended requires you to be level 100)\n",

However, AQW is a game that has cosmetics as a core part of it's make up. So the proposal of an amulet that is not visible to other player's or even the player with said amulet, despite it's numerical advantage, won't seem very appealing.\n\nThe only workaround of this is if this notion of the amulet was changed and instead we'd be farming an actual visible ultimate endgame item. I think the way to go about designing the ultimate endgame farming \"quest\", would be something akin to acquiring the Exalted Apotheosis.\n\nHowever, I think that if this is the ultimate endgame item, the merge should reflect that difficulty. The item's needed should include:\n\n* Necrotic Sword of Doom\n* Exalted Apotheosis\n* Archfiend DoomLord\n* Sepulchure's Doom Knight Armour\n* Blinding Light of Destiny\n* Armour of Awe\n* Helm of the Legion Beast\n* Awescended\n* Drakath's Armour\n* Hollowborn Reaper's Scythe\n* Blade of awe\n* Archfiend DeathLord\n\nThen to access the aforementioned merge you must have in your inventory either Void highlord (class), Legion Revenant (class) or Dragon of time (class).\n\n**Then there should be insignia's as part of the dailies from three new bosses. What do you guys think ?**\n",

            "text": "TLDR: AP + Dodge potion + health vamp   \nI have 3 luck + 1 thief but I honestly don't think it matters.\n\nSo I've been trying to farm DoT but then I've gotten stuck for the longest time at warlord icewing, because he is apparently not soloable (multiple searches in this subreddit and the only solution is YnR, which I don't have) and getting a random party at /icestormarena is nearly impossible.   \n\nSo at lvl 75, I already started trying to solo this guy, and I tried using dodge potion, dodge + full theif, dodge + healer, etc etc, but I used like 30 dodge potions and only got successfully stacked enuf commandment ONCE.  \n\nSo I decided to screw it, gridn to level 80, got lightcaster and BBOA, then went to get awe enhancements cos lvl 80, then tried soloing warlord icewing again, then it hit me. If I don't get hit during the first dodge potion duration, I can already stack enough commandment to survive a non crit hit, the problem is that I can't cycle my heal fast enough most of the time, and this is usually where I die (although sometimes icewing 1 hit crits me even w dodge potion) and I found the last part to the formula: health vamp. With health vamp, you can solo warlord icewing with a 50+% succes rate, and the good thing is you will know within 1 minute whether u succeed, because with the way AP works, the longer you live the less likely u r to die. Each successful solo takes about 20mins (yes it's not fast, but it's a solo). Dodge potion helps you not get hit while u still can't tank icewing, health vamp helps you survive when his dmg is still in the 1000-2000 range, and beyond that you win. The rule: if you pass the first one minute and you get to press 6 again, you win. After your second dodge potion he is no longer able to kill you. \n\nThe math:    \n- With 3 luck 1 thief AP base dodge is 25% , + 50% from dodge potion that 75%, it's pretty ez NOT to get hit during this period (idk how dodge really works in this game, but somehow this theoretical 75% dodge chance feels more like 98%)\n- During this you can stack about 4-5 commandment (dodge potion gives u haste buff also), that's 8% reduce dmg. Righteous seal gives 70%, AP has base 10%, that's nearly 90% Dr. I think there r diminishing returns here but usually the dmg is around the 1000-2000 range. You can survive as long as he doesn't crit you (you have also debuffed his crit chance by 8-10% so don't worry). You're can tank 1 shot, the heal restores about just nice 1 hits worth of hp, health vamps let's you effectively tank 2-3 shots, enough to get the heal off in between.     \n- During the second dodge potion, the hit chance debuff + dodge potion means he basically can't hit you here. By the end of this you should like 15 stacks, enough for his dmg to be in the 100s range with righteous seal. You win tada.   \n\nI hope this helps people who r trying to farm DoT but don't have a party / YnR\n",

I really don't know too much about VHL, but I've read that it's perfect for mid-range HP opponents. So maybe I'm looking for a great solo class for high HP opponents.\n\nThanks for the tips and advice in advance!\n",

I turn in a quest ( Nulgath Demands Work )but the server lags and doesn't let me accept my rewards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I contact Artix Support regarding this and I get this in response:\n\n  \n\" **Zohrah** (Artix Support)\n\nSep 9, 2021, 11:12 AM EDT\n\nHello,  \n\n\nThank you for contacting Artix Support.  \n\n\nWe\u2019re very sorry, but farming quests and their rewards are not tracked for how often you do them.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this does mean we cannot replace any items from them.  \n\n\nPlease refer to our [Help Page regarding lost items](https://support.artix.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000796331-I-lost-my-AQWorlds-equipment-items-AdventureCoins-etc-).  \n\n\nSincerely,  \nArtix Support  \n[https://support.artix.com](https://support.artix.com/)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I proceed to read their [Help Page regarding lost items](https://support.artix.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000796331-I-lost-my-AQWorlds-equipment-items-AdventureCoins-etc-) and I could not find my reasoning for the items I did not receive. So I reply back saying:\n\n \" **iceeeagle**\n\nSep 9, 2021, 11:51 AM EDT\n\nBut it was not my fault the server got very laggy. It was a lot of useful items that went into turning\u00a0in that quest. I literally have proof that it was the server's fault that I did not get to accept my quest rewards. If you cannot give me the quest rewards, at least give me the items that I used to turn in the quest. This makes me not want to farm that particular item at all now. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that my reply was a bit unprofessional but I was a bit annoyed by this whole situation since I was really looking forward to them giving those items back. So I wait a couple of hours and I get this reply from Zorah again:\n\n\" **Zohrah** (Artix Support)\n\nSep 9, 2021, 11:12 AM EDT\n\nHello,  \n\n\nThank you for contacting Artix Support.  \n\n\nWe\u2019re very sorry, but farming quests and their rewards are not tracked for how often you do them.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this does mean we cannot replace any items from them.  \n\n\nPlease refer to our [Help Page regarding lost items](https://support.artix.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000796331-I-lost-my-AQWorlds-equipment-items-AdventureCoins-etc-).  \n\n\nSincerely,  \nArtix Support  \n[https://support.artix.com](https://support.artix.com/)\"\n\nThey literally just copy-pasted the same exact message from before. It's like they didn't even bother to read it one bit. So curious about the way this person replies, I wanted to find out if someone else had a similar experience to this, and guess what? [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/l8r9mg/i_had_the_click_yes_bug_for_frostspirit_reaver/) proves that this just didn't happen to me. \n\nThis brings me back to the title: Is Zorah in Artix Support a bot? And is there any other way to contact someone sensible in Artix Support to resolve this issue?\n",

Assuming I am lv100 and dont need gold, class rep, xp, rep as I dont really need it. Unless there is a pet that can boost all tagged monster by 35%, the best damage boost with semi-customized set is the items mention above. Just my thought and wanted to share. Of course, if you are into dark theme which suit NSOD or Light golden theme which suit Apos\n",

            "text": " \n\nThis will be long, but if you want to go through a ride of nostalgia please feel free to read all of it.\n\nFor reference, I'm currently 18 years old and my brother is 22. Life has gone by so fast and I'm writing this because I wanted to talk about the role AQW has played in my life. When my brother and I were in our teens we would always run to the public library to play Artix Entertainment games. It was really funny, now that I look back, being so warped in a game that brought me into a completely amazing fantasy filled with adventure and other players. God, and I don't know why, but I've always been the person who could never let go. I've always held onto things from my past that give me happiness. Haha I remember the first time playing AQW in 2008. My brother introduced me to it after I watched him play dragonfable and mechquest. It was amazing; I remember the times when everyone online talked, when there were no such thing as enhancements, when the weapon dropped by the boss in Citadel was the most OP. I remember when I would come home excited for the adventure and completely new world that I was introduced to. My brother grew up, and stopped playing AQW. His friends also stopped playing, but I kept playing. I kept playing because of everything that AQW offered me. And haha I remember walking around the library looking for computers that weren't taken and I would always find someone else that was playing AQW. It was so exciting and I would ask them to play together and fuck dude I don't know how to describe nostalgia other than the feeling of being empty. I guess as time moved on, I got more and more engrossed into the game. I remember I would always play AQW when I had the chance. I would call my friends in second grade and tell them to get on. I remember faking my age so I could go on chat-servers. i remember showing all my friends in my class AQW and making them get items. Almost all my friends spent money on it too but they quickly stopped playing. It disheartened me, but I kept playing. I kept playing because I just can't let go of the good things of my past. I guess as I started growing up and bigger games started to become popular, I stopped going on AQW as much. I would not login for months and my online friends would skype me asking where I've been (I'm still following a lot of them on social media today). AQW helped me relax? I don't know the word. I remember grinding PVP to get on the top 100 list on youtube, I remember joining battleon-4311 and getting called a noob.If you're still reading comment purple elephant. I remember when Cysero was always full and the game capped at 3k people per server. I remember so so much. For Gods sake, I remember when Nulgath was called Miltonius and when ONLY members had pets. I even remember memorizing the path to get to Miltonius and that Juggernaut was literally the hardest quest. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I love Artix Entertainment. I love AQW. I have loved everything about this game. But I think its time that I move on and let go. The game is headed in a direction where I don't really enjoy the game anymore and I think it's honestly because I've been growing up. Sure, the AE team might be doing things wrong, but man just think about all the good memories their games have given us. It's been so good, and this game will always have a place in my heart. There's more I wish I could say but I'll leave it for now. I don't know why I wrote this. If you guys have anything to say or share, that would be pretty awesome.\n\nThanks for reading if you did\n",

I spent 10,000 AC getting them both and the quests they had before was trash really and now when the update came the money spent was definitely worth it! Then they decided to change the quest \"Diamond Exchange\" which has always THROUGHOUT the years been 3x Diamonds of nulgath and in the later years also a Nulgath rune 9 required to get 1 Unidentified 13 to complete the quest. And now they decided to NERF it again making it even harder to complete. Now you need 15x diamonds of nulgath and 1 nulgath rune 9 which is completely nonsense, the quest is useless now. You ruined everything that was good with the buff and I am beyond disappointed in you, aqw team, for making that nerf. 15x diamonds for 1 uni 13, do you hear how stupid that is? 5x diamonds would have been acceptable BUT NOT 15x. Quest name: \"Diamond exchange\" when it should be \"Become bankrupt\" or \"Soul exchange\" also \"Spend 5k AC for nothing\". These were examples for what the quest's name should be. I hope you'll consider changing the quest because currently it's beyond unacceptable for what you have done. 5x diamonds would be logical, not 15x. I know this is old but ffs.  \n\n\nKind regards,  \npae00\n",

First, I need to give a little bit of backstory: a few months ago I was able to utilize the unstable dark sprites daggers (can deal negative damage) and frostvale barbarian (heals allies based on weapon damage) in order to create a DoT on other players. So I would go into Yulgar and troll some afk players by killing them. It was loads of good fun until some players got salty and started reporting me. Well, about a week later, they updated Frostvale Barbarian so it now has a static heal, meaning the heal is constant and never varies. Well, I'm bored with the game again and would love to give it another go. So does anybody know of any classes which does what I'm looking for?\n",

            "text": "Chaos Slayer is actually a pretty ridiculous farming class and honestly I don't know why more people don't use it. It's very underrated and not many people use this class anymore even though it's really good. Here are some things that those of you who don't use this class should know.\n\n**This class isn't even hard to get you just need rank 10 chaos.** \n\nWait until there is a double reputation boost and then go farm it. You can probably get it to rank 10 within the day. \n\n**This class has insane farming DPS**\n\nThe funny thing about Chaos Slayer is that your auto attacks are really strong. They apply chaos blight which boosts your outgoing damage my 3% and stacks to 30 (90% damage boost at max stacks). My character is level 92 and without spiral carve or any damage boosting weapons my autos hit for like 5-6k damage. If I use spiral carve they can hit for 10k damage and with a damage boosting weapon even higher. With Enigma (3rd skill) and autos alone this class can keep up with other top tier farmers. Once you add in the 5th skill it puts most farmers to shame. \n\n**This class is better at Legion Revenant at farming**\n\nYes, I am not joking. LR is not the best farming class in the game, not even second best. Chaos slayer is consistently faster. If you don't believe me go watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW32ewZhHMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW32ewZhHMk). It's also better than Shadowscythe General, Vampire Lord, Shaman, and probably anything else you're thinking of. The only classes that top Chaos Slayer in farming are Master of Moglins and Nechronomancer. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStop using LR and Shadowscythe General to farm and go get Chaos Slayer trust me it's good.\n",

            "text": "Sword Master is actually much better than I initially thought it was. After it got power crept out of the pvp meta by classes like TimeKeeper and VHL, I thought it was useless since that was what most people used it for. But after playing around with it a bit, I found out its actually still pretty useful. Here's some reasons why you should pick it up. \n\n**It's actually a crazy good solo class**\n\nI thought this class might be decent at soloing but after trying it out it exceeded my expectations. It has a lot of damage mitigation along with a high dodge chance. Two abilities apply Spinning Dragon which reduce the next auto attack to 0 damage, and its 4th ability can reduce the enemy outgoing damage by 70%. Did I mention it also has a stun on the 5th ability? You can actually just straight up avoid all damage or at least most of it by carefully timing your abilities, and your high dodge chance can make up for the mistakes. I was able to solo Supreme Shadowscythe with this thing which hits for 2k on auto attacks (criticals hit for 4-5k). While this class may not be as great as some of the other solo classes for DPS, when it comes to survivability it actually does better than most of them.\n\n**It's easy to get**\n\nAll you need is 2k legion tokens which isn't hard to do at all. Most of the time at /legionarena there is a bunch of people farming tokens there. I got this class in a few hours. If you don't already have VHL or ArchPaladin, you should consider picking this class up for soloing bosses who hit really hard. \n\n**It's still good in pvp**\n\nDoes this class get bodied by TimeKeeper and a good amount of other meta classes? Yeah it does. But this class also invalidates a whole bunch of other class matchups as well. So not the best but if you need a pvp class this is a good choice. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGo get Sword Master it's good I promise.\n",

And can have more than 1 pet and pets?\n\n4: New rarity pets. The harder a pet is to get the stronger it would be and the more it would help.\n\nIMPORTANT: All I wanna do is just to improve games quality. Because in the state that it is right now the game itself is boring af and noone can actually play it without falling asleep. In the entire game the only interesting thing i found was the bass in doomvaultb where i was forced to use my brain to deafet him and not brainlessly spamming skills xD I actually needed reaction and pay attention to kill it and aqw needs more stuff like this. They could realese less updates but quality ones like 1 update per month and with new cool stuff and not recolored maps and boring shit as it is rn. I hope this thing will get to someone from AE and they will see what im trynna to do here. Btw if u go to my channel u can see even more ideas that i have posted to improve the game quality and does anyone know any way how could i reach the AE members and show this letter to them?\n",

            "text": "ShadowStalker of Time (also known as ShadowWeaver of Time and ShadowWalker of Time) is easily one of the best chrono classes in the game currently. Even after the nerf to the DoT nuke, it's still better than most of the other chronos. Here are some reasons you should choose this over the other options: \n\n(I will be referring to the class as SSoT from here on)\n\n**It's not a one trick pony**\n\nSSoT is actually pretty versatile. Pretty much all the other chrono classes are good at one thing and that's it and don't have a purpose outside of soloing and group DPS. This class can be used for just about anything except support.\n\n**Farming Potential**\n\nI never relied on this class for farming until I had to farm monsters with really high hp for Dragon of Time. This class actually farms high hp monsters very effectively because of it's double nuke. In one ability cycle you can nuke an enemy and once it dies you can switch targets and kill another enemy with the second one. This may not be useful for monsters with like 5k hp, but when you have to kill hundreds of monsters with over 20k hp it makes a big difference. It's not bad at farming lower hp monsters either. It doesn't perform as good as the top tier farmers, but it can keep up with the A tier farming classes. \n\n**Solo Potential**\n\nThis class is among the highest DPS solo classes in the game. Sure there are other chrono classes that can nuke higher than SSoT, but that's pretty much all they can do. SSoT can solo effectively due to it having high dodge chance and some built in sustain. For bosses where the sustain isn't enough you can switch to health vamp to make up for it. Now obviously this class isn't be best chrono class for soloing, but it's still a very good one. \n\n**PVP Potential**\n\nI can't go too deep into the pvp potential of this class since I don't do much pvp myself. But from what I have seen this class is very good in pvp unlike most of the other chrono classes. This isn't surprising considering it has a high dodge chance and then has an ability that boosts it further. Combine this with its high burst DPS and it becomes pretty stupid. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSSoT isn't better than Corrupted Chronomancer for soloing, and not better than Nechronomancer for farming, but unlike both of those classes it can do both well. Since this class doesn't have all of its eggs in one basket, you could say its more useful than the other chronos. In conclusion, go get SSoT it's good I promise.\n",

            "text": "First thing, when I say farming I don't mean bosses. I usually refer to that as soloing but I don't know if everyone does. \n\nThere are a variety of farming classes in the game. Generally in the endgame people are using classes such as Legion Revenant and Nechronomancer for farming. This is no surprise since these classes are barely contested in their ability to farm. People usually place these at the top of their lists because of this. Obviously this is justified, but there is a problem with a general tier list. \n\n**The Problem With Tier Lists**\n\nIn a grindy game like AQW it's important to think about efficiency. And when taking efficiency for all scenarios into account, directly comparing the general farming ability of two classes doesn't make much sense. While a class like Dragonlord is about an A tier farmer generally, when farming low HP monsters it becomes S tier. A class like Chaos Slayer is also about an A tier farmer in general. But when farming higher HP enemies it also has top tier potential. In the HP ranges these classes specialize in they can keep up with or even outperform the top tier classes. But if someone looks at a tier list they won't know this. All they will see is that one class is better or worse than another. \n\n**My Approach**\n\nI think we should start making tier lists based on enemy hp rather than general farming potential. For example, I could give Dragonlord an S tier rating for low hp enemies, an A tier rating for mid range hp enemies, and a B tier rating for high hp enemies. This way there's no confusion and people know what class to use for the monsters they need to farm when looking at the lists. I think they can be more helpful this way for less experienced players. \n\n**Discussion**\n\nWhat are your ideas for how we could better rate farming classes? Or do you think that the general tier list is fine?\n",

I used my ioads for VHL, LR, NSOD and Icy and I am also level 100. As soon as I got those items, I was happy for a day and then the diminishing return kicked in and I started to get bored and less excited about using the items. I realised earning it was much more rewarding and fulfilling than buying it outright so I made a 2nd acc and I bought a 1 month mem and 2k acs to get started and grind for it this time.\n\nTLDR: If you really want a cosmetic item then go get it but don't spend your iodas on farmable things as it takes away from the enjoyment of still playing the game to earn those items.\n\nHope you enjoyed my little soliloquy.

And every. single. person that I came across were real people, not a single bot in what is probably 20 hours. Everyone is talking, being nice, asking questions and just enjoying the farming rather than having a bot do it for them and I love it! \n\nIf you have the pets, head on over to /nulgath for some great farming and maybe I'll see you there!

I have bought member with acs and planning to buy chrono class just for fun. Cause there is no other use for acs other than cosmetics which i dont really care. But hearing everyone got free 6 heromarts points means everyone got a free chrono class. I feel if i spend 6k acs on a class while many got it for free I feel it has no value for tue 6k acs. Do any of u, after they give heromart but ur account did not receive it feel the same way? Should I never buy chrono with acs at all due to this?\n",

Since that time we continued to improve the launcher the best we can, while keeping up with spider's testing releases! The current aquastar uses his test, and a new version with the new vanilla aqw will come out when its time. As for now...  \n\n\nAquastar can do so much more now. We added support for:\n\n* Custom Keybindings in a new file, with a \"How To\" on github if needed.\n* **Recording your game screen**!\n* Easy access of many usefull links, including Daily Drop page and Calendar of events, or this very subreddit or twitter to just see whats going on.\n* Custom char page Screenshot with Alt K (on a char page screen) which can go up to 4K (it does your monitor resolution by default) that shows the player's color custom list!\n* Support for Chromebooks was found out. Check out the readme.md\n* [And everything I said the last time for 1.0!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AQW/comments/o5rqj3/aquastar_aqlite_in_linux_and_other_qol/)\n\nIts free to download (and it will always be) on our github page! Any suggestions, questions and such can be posted here or an issue filled on github.\n\n[Aquastar Download Page](https://github.com/aquaspy/AquaStar/releases). Download the right version for your pc, and remember that i386 means x32 bits.  \n\n\nAnd remember, Linux users: For anything downloaded from the web, you NEED to go into the file properties and mark it as executable! Else you might not be able to run it.\n\nAnd Windows users: The windows version is an installer, and not a standalone. After install, check out your Windows menu the next times.\n",

            "text": "After a long talk with a friend, we realized how much we like AQW, but the game has A LOT of flaws.\n\n1 - TERRIBLY OPTIMISED. I have a PC that runs LoL in 300 FPS, but AQW lags A LOT  \n2 - TERRIBLE walking animations. I'm pretty sure that i'm not the only one that HATES when a lower armor part just enter the character when you walk   \n3 - Boring PvP. It's just nonsense and boring. I bet most players used PvP to get Nulgath's DB.  \n\n\nHow you can fix these flaws? with money, like, A LOT of money. It is pretty obvious that, as a indie developer, AE for sure don't have the amount of money you need to fix all these terrible issues, that's when it came an idea: why AQW don't bring back LQS (limited quanty shop) items, but make those items as NFT? NFT market is super hot rn, whoud definitely bring more players to the game, and the game also could create a cryptocoin itself  \n\n\nBut how this would work? well, think about the most grindy and hard items to get: (VHL, RN, NSoD, BLoD, BoA, among others.), now imagine having as grindy items, like swords or pets, even armors, but categorized as NFT? It also would be necessary to create a new trading system outside the game to insert AE into the cryptocurrencies and NFT art market.  \n\n\nAnd, as you probably guessed, it would move A LOT of money, by getting new players that would probably start to enjoy the new and better optimized game, and creating what could be a awesome community.  \n\n\nAQW isn't boring, neither ugly. I love the game art style and farming mechanics, the game LORE is also fantastic! so that's why i think it deserves to be great\n",

            "text": "I have had so much fun with this game and have met so many other great players in the last few months and I just wanted to write about my journey with the game and everything I've done in it since I returned in the first week of July, just before the Calander class stuff happened.\n\nThe last time I really played this game was in 2015, when I was in a very different place in life and just gearing up for University. Since then I have only logged in for a few days every year before leaving it again. I never really took the game seriously and most of the grinds that were available at the time seemed so ridiculous that I never bothered with them. Heck I didn't even make it further than level 53 or do the 13 Lord of Chaos storyline. But now here I am in September, with pretty all the major Grinds done except NSoD, LR and Awecention finished (Though honestly I just need the helm of awe).\n\nMy Journey:\n\nSo I started in early July, I had actually seen an AD for AQW and having suddenly acquired a massive amount of free time I decided to get back into the game and see how much it had changed. Not much had changed honestly, but I was very quickly pointed to AQLite, which held a massive amount of QoL features I felt the game was lacking. \n\nFrom here I started by setting about creating objectives for myself to reach. First I finished the 13rd lords of chaos questline and focused on grinding for one of the Chaos Classes (Strongest classes I had at this point was Shaman, Troll Spellsmith and Necromancer). This helped me a lot in terms of farming and I pushed myself to reach level 75 by the end of my first week. Next I went and got Sepulchures Original Helm. This was honestly the first time I done any grind purely for the purpose of having a cosmetic item, and it felt great!\n\nAt this point I knew I needed some classes that could carry me further. With over 2500 Ac's built up in my account I decided to join the legion and start the quest for lightcaster after reaching level 81. So I grinded the reputations for Stonecrusher (I LOVE this class) and by the end of my second week I also got Blaze Binder (Already had Pyro), Lightcaster and Legion Dark Caster. \n\nNow into my third week I knew I wanted to start some of the bigger grinds  and having heard there were changes to Awe enhancements I decided to warm up by doing the Blade of Awe and Armor of Awe quests and Upgrading Sepulchures helm. After that I headed for Necropolis to get Started on the BLoD. I didn't realize how large of a gap there was between the big grinds and the middle tier ones until I started this. Even with massive amounts of free time and some lost sleep it still took me most of the week to grind up everything necessary for it. At the same time I was building up some Elder's blood because I knew what I wanted to start soon.\n\nAt this point August had already begun and having gotten just gotten the BloD I wanted to get the other big ticket item, SDKA. To my dismay it was member only, but having already spent so much time with the game I bit the bullet and got member and a bunch of ACs. Again just like BLoD it too me nearly all of that week to grind for it met some players along the way who were also grinding for it who were nice and we decided to work together. Riding the high of having gotten these two awesome items I decided to focus on smaller grinds like Arch Doomknight and some of the alternate versions of BLoD.\n\nHaving taken a small break I put pretty much everything else aside and for days just grinded icestormarena until I was Level 100, whilst farming up some of the basic resources for VHL in between when I got tired. Then i split focus between VHL and Legion Revenant, before solely trying to complete VHL. Man oh man this grind was absoluetly insane, had to take it day by day or i would have lost my MIND but by the end of the last week of August I had done it! VHL was MINE! I was so happy, i never knew this game could bring me such a feeling of fulfillment but yet here I was proud as can be of what I had accomplished. After that I just went and got Dragon of Time, Drakaths Armor and up until today spent all of my left over resources from VHL farming on nation items and managed to get Archfiend Doomlord about 2 days ago.\n\nSo I had a lot of fun over the last few months and though I only highlighted what I would consider the major grinds I have done a lot of other stuff in between.\n\n If you made it this far, thanks for reading! And thank you to the AQW community for all the help I got from players and the randoms in Yulgar who helped me power through some tough bosses.\n\nI have really come to love this game and it's community and I can't wait to see where else the game takes me<3\n",

            "text": "Back in the day classes would be considered effective for soloing if they just had a decent heal and mana sustain. That's pretty much all you needed to get through the story bosses and older events. But the times have changed. A lot of the bosses from the more recent adventures and events hit really hard or just straight up one shot you. Most of classes we used to consider great solo classes can't sustain their hp against a lot of the newer/endgame bosses. So then what do we use to kill these? Dodge classes. I'm going to go over some reasons why I think dodge classes have become a necessity in the endgame.\n\n**Heals and damage mitigation aren't enough anymore**\n\nA lot of solo classes have a heal and damage reduction (ex: Light Caster, Necromancer). These two things are enough to handle most bosses in the game. However once you get to the endgame this changes. A good amount of endgame content requires you to kill bosses that hit so hard that heals and reduction aren't enough to survive. Unless you are reaching VHL and ArchPaladin levels of reduction (combined with a good heal) it's impossible to stay alive. \n\n**Dodge classes are consistent** \n\nThis may not be true for lower level players but it is for higher level players since their evasion will be higher. Dodge classes like sword master and timekeeper can easily max out their evasion and go the entire fight without ever getting hit. This means any boss that doesn't have an attack that is guaranteed to hit is a piece of cake for dodge classes. VHL and ArchPaladin are great but can still die if you get unlucky enough to get crit by the boss like 3 times in a row. Not to mention that there are some bosses that hit so hard that even VHL and ArchPaladin still get oneshot. \n\n**People play this game solo**\n\nThe reason why a lot of the endgame and newer bosses hit so hard is because they aren't meant to be soloed. They were designed to be taken on with a party of players which could easily deal with the ridiculous damage. This wouldn't be an issue if there weren't a ton of people who play this game mostly solo. A lot of people don't have friends who play the game, or simply just prefer the solo experience. As a result, solo players will find themselves in the situations I talked about earlier as they try to farm for endgame content. Having a dodge class is very useful for solo players who need to kill tough bosses. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNow that AE is increasing boss difficulty in this game it's important to pick up a dodge class for boss fights. If you have an active guild or friends who play the game you might not need a dodge class, but for a lot of people this isn't the case. Go get a dodge class they are good I promise.\n",

The armor and cape of this shop gives you +25% damage to all monsters, but the requirements for it are really crazy. If you want to get both items, you will need 58.275 bone dusts, 70.000 dage's favor and 14.000 dark tokens.   \n\n\nThe items are beautiful, but the farm is ridiculous.

Still haven't redeemed my HeroPoints yet, largely just forgot while waiting to see if Timekeeper would get hit again, but I'm feeling like it now.\n\nDecided Nechrono is a waste so I'm focusing on solo value. Also decided I have too much unreliable lag to bother with the harder classes so unfortunately no CCM/UCM or SWOT, as interested I became in SWOT.\n\nObvious pickup would be Timekeeper of course, but there's some lingering questions. I've noticed Chronomancer Prime picking up steam around here recently but I'm not exactly sure of the pros and cons between Timekeeper and it. There's also Commandant who I initially believed to just be a tauntbot only truly useful for Tyndarius, but it's seeming like it's a lot valuable than I give it credit for, but again I'm still unsure how it stacks up to Timekeeper and Chrono Prime.\n\nSo ultimately my decision is between Timekeeper, Chrono Prime, or Commandant. Still no \"hardcore farm\" classes under my belt.\n",

Since the end of 2019, MOST classes they created were more suited to PvP and don't shine too much in another areas (soloing, farming or support).   \n\n\nDark Lord: farm.  \nFrost Spirit Reaver: PvP (main), viable for soloing.  \nDragon Of Time: PvP (main), good for farming.  \nYami no Ronin: PvP (main), good for soloing.  \nNorthlands Monk: support.\n\n  \nThis is not good in my opinion, because PvP is dead and boring, and the system has thousands of problems and its unrewarding.\n",

            "image": null,
            "text": "This weekly update brought us the hardest boss ever to be introduced into the game, Champion Drakath. The new class, Chaos Avenger is locked behind this guy, so if you want to get the new class you'll need to learn how to beat him.\n\nThere is a couple different strategies, one involving the classes CmD, SC, AP, and LoO, and the other F2P method is VHL, SC, AP, LoO (ive only had experience with the F2P method so I will only be talking about that one).\n\n***Champion of Chaos's abilities:***\n\nDrakath is pretty simple when compared to other ultra bosses, as he only has one ability which is his nuke. His nuke activates approximately every 2 million damage dealt, ex. 18 mil health left he nukes, 16 mil health left he nukes, and so on. This means support have to save their heals as his health-bar approaches the next 2 mil mark. Support such as LoO don't have to worry as much as their heals don't heal for much anyways, but this is much more important for APs as they heal for much more.\n\nHis other \"ability\" is his basic attack which increases in damage as the fight progresses. In the first minute or so he will only be tickling you with a feather, but towards the end he will be tickling you with an active chainsaw, therefore making support very important in this fight.\n\n***Potions and scrolls:***\n\nThe Scroll of Enrage is ABSOLUTELY crucial to this fight, and using the F2P method is literally impossible without. What this item does is taunts the enemy into attacking the user all the while decreasing the enemy's damage by 15% (this item's effects last for 10 seconds). Since you will be taunting the enemy, you must have high HP, making the best candidate for the item VHL. The user (VHL) must use the item slightly before 2 mil damage is dealt, or else everyone is one shot (this means that this item should go to someone who has relatively good internet and doesn't lag).\n\nPotions are not needed in this fight, but obviously don't hurt. These items should be given to the support. The potions I recommend are Battle Elixir, Body Tonic, and Potent Honour Potion. Keep the buffs from these item active at all times to ensure the highest chance of beating Mr. Drakath.\n\n***Class Guides:***\n\n**VHL** is the most important class in the fight. The combo goes as follows, 2,3,5 (use these 3 abilities as they come of cool down). As previously mentioned, VHL should used Scroll of Enrage slightly before 2 million damage is dealt (ex. 18.05 mil is when you use it). Other than that, time it well and you should be good.\n\n**LoO** is one of the three supports used in the F2P method. Not much to say, before you start attacking the boss, use the combo 2,3,4,5 and than spam these abilities for the next 5-7 minutes.\n\n**AP** is slightly more complicated than LoO but still pretty easy. Buff with 3 before the fight commences and use 2 and 4 as they come off cool down. NEVER USE 5 for the fight, or else you will quickly die and will have to restart (besides everyone else will flame you). \n\n**SC** is the final support used in this team comp. Buff with 3 and 4, then use 2 and 5, use these off of cool down. Nothing else to say besides the combo. No really, literally nothing else to say. Why are you still reading. \n\n***Tips and Tricks:***\n\nAll classes should be using fighter enh on the class (no other pieces of gear) in order to have the most amounts of health.\n\nMake sure that all teammates stand close to each other so that shorter range classes such as LoO don't have to run around.\n\nChrono cheese will not work on this boss due to damage resistance after a 50k attack, so don't whip out your CDK thinking you'll one shot Drakath. \n\n***Final Notes:***\n\nDrakath is the toughest boss ever to be added to the game, so don't feel bad if you don't get the kill after a couple attempts. Get a couple friends or guild members together to be as organized as possible. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask and ill answer to the best of my ability. With all that out of the way, good luck fellow adventures of lore.\n",

            "text": "So, after many frustrating attempts, we actually defeated Champion Drakath. This is in NO WAY a guide whatsoever, just my observations throughout the fight and thoughts of this boss in particular. I am not a try-harder in this game (srsly who even try hards this game?), so apologies if this isn't specific/detailed/whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I've observed that there are 3 phases throughout the fight.\n\na. Casual Phase\n\nIn this phase, Champion Drakath (CD) doesn't do a lot of damage and is almost just like   \nyour average boss. This lasts for about 20M - 10M health. However, his debuffs start to   \naccumulate in the beginning, making later phases harder. I have no idea what the   \ndebuffs do exactly so might need to research on that one.\n\nb. Enraged Phase\n\nWhen health drops to 10M, he'll have a new form, and will do increased damage. This is   \nwhere support classes shine, and will keep your whole party alive. Be careful during this   \nphase, as one wrong move and your whole party goes down. Timing healing during his   \nhigh-damage attacks is crucial to avoid deaths to your party. This phase lasts from 10M -   \n2M health.\n\nc. Nuke/Rush Phase\n\nWhen his health reaches 2M, you've got approximately 20 seconds before he nukes and   \nkills everyone in your party, resetting the boss from the beginning. I counted it when we   \nreached 2M, but I'm not sure if it's exactly 20 seconds. The nuke is unavoidable and will   \nhit everyone. One trick we did was that one of my party members died on purpose   \naround 3M health, and then changed his class to VHL to kill it ASAP, because you can't   \nleave the room CD is in and the only way to go back to the first screen is to die.\n\n2. If one of your support dies, it can either make your whole party fall apart, or if quick enough, can be salvageable. The thing is, all buffs are crucial to reduce the damage especially during the second phase, since support classes are the cornerstone of a party.\n\n3. The second phase is a slog to get through without potions (we used Potent Honor Potion), and even then, that is still pretty slow. It might have something to do with his debuffs. The first debuff, Chaorrupted, starts in the beginning, while the second debuff, Crippled, only starts at the second phase, which is what I've observed. I don't really know what specific debuffs they apply to you or your party, so might have to wait for Wiki to update it.\n\n4. My thoughts is that this isn't really a bad boss. The Ultras from Timeinn worked because they were new at the time, but for me, this is starting to get stale. AE really lacks innovation when it comes to designing boss fights such as these. Like the Ultras, you NEED, and I can't stress this enough, but YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED a party for this one. Friends or guildmates, but absolutely NOT strangers. You need to plan out what classes you're gonna use, potions, etc.\n\nA huge thanks to these guys for all the teamwork to take this boss down:\n\nZMasterLolipoZ - our healer. ArchPaladin.\n\nleonxdmassa - our second support. Infinity Titan.\n\nehsay35 - our tank, and DPS for third phase. Naval Commander/Void Highlord.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhisupm8zq71.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=59e6ab3f007738b2c02f7eb68a0fb96ff8a9883c\n",

All the things we've had to do before ultrabosses were a thing were a bunch of mind nubmbing tedious farms that didn't really require any killing of OP bosses (With the exception of DoT)\n\nHell back then I would consider Protosartorium, Red Dragon an ultraboss when trying to kill them with nothing but starter class. \n\nKilling Champion Drakath gave me that same rush from days of yore. The same rush of running back and forth to the safe zone when fighting Ledgermayne. If Dark Souls has taught me anything it's okay to die, it's okay to take a rest, Jolly Cooperation can turn the tide of battle. It's okay as long as you don't give up. It's difficult, it's frustrating but it's not impossible.

            "text": "Team comp: VHL, LoO, LR (can be swapped with LC) and AP\n\nDrakath mechanics: He will apply Chaorrupted to you each attack and it will increase the damage you take over time. Everytime he lose 2 million health he will launch a 3k damage nuke and buff his damage by a lot, but temporarily . He won't launch a nuke when he's at 10 million health, he will enter his more \"chaotic form\" and decrease your damage as well buffing his dodge chance. From now on he will start to nuke again for each 2 million health lost until he reaches 2 million health where he will enter a charging state. He doesn't attack during this state. If you don't kill him in 30 seconds he will launch an unavoidable nuke that will kill everybody.\n\nNow this is what each team member needs to do:\n\n- VHL : \n\nThis is the most important member. Do not use unshackled. Your teammates will die a lot and you will be the last man standing most of the times when Drakath is below 10 million health. YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO USE SCROLL OF ENRAGE OTHERWISE YOU'RE USELESS! When Drakath is about to lose 2 million health activate the scroll because Focus only lasts 6 seconds. The nuke will only hit you and not the whole team. Make sure you have more than 3000 health when that happens.\n\nWhen Drakath is below 10 million health try to keep your Congealed stacks on Drakath to reduce his dodge chance. Make this skill a priority above any other skill as soon as it recharges. You do not want to miss your auto attacks and let Soul Fend fade. This will also help party DPS because they will hit him more often. You will miss sometimes.\n\n- LoO :\n\nLOOP YOUR SKILL BUFFS! I can't tell you how many times players let their buffs fade. They only last for like 8-10 seconds.\n\nThis class is important because it increases your hit chance (important below 10 million HP,helps VHL stay alive by a lot) , haste, stats and crit damage. Can also make Drakath harmless for 4 seconds every 25 seconds or after each death, buying yourself and your team more time to stack the buffs after they respawn.\n\n- LR/LC :\n\nLR just spam. Another class that boosts hit chance and damage. LC time your heals and don't heal at the same time with AP. Improves hit chance by 10% less but it has better damage buffs in the long run.\n\n- AP :\n\nDon't heal at the same time with LC if it's there. Don't use skill 5.\n\nYou need both defense and damage. Drakath gets stronger over time and stalling with too much defense will fail eventually, especially below 2 million health.\n",

Many of us have dreamed that one day, maybe just one day, AE will finally pay attention to the Faction that started them off\n\nAnd here we are. At long last, I never thought I'd get to see the day where AE, in their Birthday nonetheless, would put a smile on my face. I've despised, hated and loathed AE for their shitty tactics of running gams and terrible actions overall. But now (until their next fuck up), I am here to personally (yet publicly) thank AE for their decision. In all honesty, they are on a roll of good updates, and I can only hope it'll last long.\n\nThis isn't a review, a criticism or a suck up post to AE. Normally I would be here talking about the releases, but right now I'm feeling deeply emotional about this update. From a Chaos Fanboy since childhood, this post is only dedicated to show affection to the new event. I'll still review the entirety of the event (Because how could I not? IT'S CHAOS!), but for now, I hope this message reaches out to them.\n\nThank you. And Happy Birthday\n",

AP should never use his last skill and LR should spam Scrolls of Enrage. Beware that Scroll of Enrage sometimes don't work so you have to keep trying (I usually equip another class than buff again).\n\nThe hardest part is reaching the end of the fight, but if you mange to reach it with out anyone dying you should be able to finish the boss (having dmg boosting equipment is mandatory, especially for LR).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout other strategies:\n\nNC + LOO + SC + AP - The problem with this comp is that you can't really finish the boss in 30 seconds\n\nVHL + AP + LOO + SC/LC  - Less consistent as the LR buff will help AP/LOO/SC/LC to stay alive after Drakath drops below 50% hp.\n\nNote: If you use LC instead of SC in this comp AP and LOO will most likely need mana vamp weapons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Already accepted the drop, was to afraid of disconnect ](https://preview.redd.it/5njq5m7ac2r71.jpg?width=1193&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d02b25f5636e43c11f39b1247dfd88e868ba58bd)\n\n[Insignia proof](https://preview.redd.it/ouldo0obd2r71.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=758161e17772710631dcbe49c5775c15c13240d1)\n",

We used the typical enhancements no special changes but all of us had saved potent honor potion for the burst phase at 2m HP. \n\nUse of Elixirs and Tonics is highly recommended, use whatever seem useful to your class/role.\n\nFB use only 234, basically healer mode until the burst phase where he starts using 2345. We used FB instead of SC because we werent doing enough dps at burst phase when we had sc, FB seems to help at reaching the necessary dps to beat the boss.\n\nAP use only 234, use 5 when boss is at 250k hp left or less.\n\nLoO and NC basically spam their skills. \n\nNC can be changed with DKL. If tanking with DKL, use all your skills until last phase where you stop using 5 so you can burst the boss faster.\n\nOne more thing, this fight can be annoying and the boss may sometimes wipe you randomly, dont get frustrated and rage quit on your teammates, ultra bosses require patience that most AQW players just dont have. Just take a breath, check your elixir and tonic, equip back your honor potion and go at it again. \n\nHope this take will help you beat this boss. Cheers!\n",

The LoO and AP time their healings well, AP takes care of the healing after each nuke.\n\nAt 8.5, 6.5 and 4.5 million HP the AP in the team stops healing (except for emergency healing) in order for NC to taunt the nukes at 8, 6 and 4 million HP and die.\nThis was done so Drakath wouldn't receive the buffs.\n\nAfter the NC in the team dies from the nuke at 4 million HP he/she switches to VHL and goes back in the fight. \nThis might be a little risky but the VHL gets Drakath to 2 million HP very fast, and with Drakath not dodging the SC should be able to maintain high DoT.\n\nAt a little over 2 million HP it's time to use the potion. The AP nukes and then just continues using 2. The bosses health should go down well within the timer with this method. \n\nI've seen a very similar strategy where the NC logs out and switches to VHL, and that can also be an option if NC fails to die at 4 million HP. \n\nIf anyone has any tips to make this fight even easier then please let me know :)\n",

The goal is to use NC and spam 1-2-3 until the boss drops 4million. It will definitely nuke you as you have the first skill which makes the boss focus on you. Once you die, respawn and quickly equip VHL with potion and go full defensive (skill combo 1-2-3).\n\nOnce the boss drops to 2million health, everyone pop potion and go all out offensive. This is the VHL vital role, spam 2-3-4 and if need more dps, change between skill 1 and 3 so that offensive is active. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe goal here is simple- to drag the fight down to 4 million- it will take a while but thats the point, you need to survive until then so when NC dies when drakath health drops down to 4million, you can change NC to VHL a dps class and drakath wont do any ludicrous damage, so the favor is on your end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suck at explaining so plz feel free to ask me if there is anything you dont understand and i can help out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeace,\n\nand goodluck\n",

            "text": "It seems like everyone knows to use potent honor potion for the last million of champion drakath, but I'm not seeing people mention using elixirs and tonics.\n\nBefore you start the fight, pop an elixir **and** a tonic. Physical damage classes will probably want Battle Elixir and casters will want Malevolence Elixir. For tonic, I think Fate is the best one for damage. You can use **both** an elixir **and** tonic. The effects stack. Use both of them before the fight and then equip your Potent Honor Potion. They make a big difference in damage. Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5m59TBc6ow) video out to see how much it affects damage.\n\nI say all this because one of the best comps is CCM/LoO/SC/AP since it's almost unkillable up until the nuke, but it struggles with the dps check. If everyone has a tonic/elixir running and uses the honor potion, you can easily pass the dps check. But I think too few know how potions work. I didn't know that you could stack an elixir and tonic until yesterday.\n\nHope this helps everyone.\n",

Kinda shit against Iara because the debuff shitcans your damage and Iara does no real damage herself, great against Ezrajal if the other 3 clowns don't hit counter, didn't even bother on Engi because there's no way it's useful, Tyndarius and Drakath value is known but I haven't touched them yet.\n\nHowever what interested me in playing was how it performed against Warden. I died. A lot. Yet despite almost chain-dying at times, the runs were shockingly stable and consistent and it took me a bit to realize why.\n\nWhat often folds Warden fights is the threshold instabop. If that hits your AP then you're in for a shaky time and a likelihood of everyone getting picked off while the AP respawns. However because of Commandant's taunt, if anyone got instabopped it would only ever be *me* which both buys safety, but more importantly *time*, for the AP to pick everyone off 1 HP.\n\nThere's still room for me to improve at playing Commandant in this fight. I need to manage burst better so I'm not triggering thresholds too quickly for AP to keep up. Ironically, I need to not trust my AP so much and just hit my self-heal without worrying about it being redundant. But despite these personal shortcomings, Commandant feels *great* on this fight.\n\nIt reminds me of the suicide NC strats on Drakath where you have someone taunt and dying to the threshold nukes to protect everyone else and drop debuffs, and it makes me wonder if Taunt/LOO/AP/SC is the superior Warden meta to the standard LR/LOO/AP/SC comp.\n",

Best one is Legion Revenant. Remember change weapon with best AWE if needed (like Shaman with Mana Vamp) and re-equip Scroll of Enrage.\n\nFree player version with Shaman instead of LR: https://youtu.be/1T_epvgP1j8\n",

From 2013-2021, I have been playing this game actively every day and was always looking forward to weekly updates. I basically gave my left nut for this account throughout the years of playing/grinding for end-game items. I love AQW despite the game being old school, 2D, and flash-based.

If he remembers me or this game, then there might be a possibility. Even then it would probably be a complicated matter for him to bother since I am not given any further chances to reply or explain myself.** \n\n**Providing context and evidence that he passed the account still violates AE's rules of account sharing.

It's just a preview but it gets the job done and you can tell the class is gonna be very strong.\n",

Especially when it comes to soloing.\n\nThoughts?\n",

This class combined with its high dps and defense make it one of the best solo classes for free players in the game right now. But this isn't enough.\n\n**This class is a worse vhl.**\n\nHonestly this class should be worse than vhl since the farm is much easier, but this becomes a problem when most people are using vhl to get this class. Even though this class is slightly tankier it still can't solo anything vhl can't solo, and it has lower dps. This kind of makes this class useless for most of the people who are going to obtain it since it is primarily a solo/tank class. Considering that killing drakath is a pain in the ass especially for randoms, right now it isn't worth it for a lot of players. \n\n**What does the class need?**\n\nThis class is in a tough spot since its problematic if its better than vhl at soloing but also problematic if its worse. I've seen a lot of people suggest adding a taunt to help make this class stand out but I think it will need more than that. What do you guys think this class could use? I'm going to make a list of all the potential buffs I see later on.\n",

Suddenly, this music that is so nostalgic to me which is Moment of Truth by FM Static made me remember those days back in 2009. Playing AQW, roaming around aimlessly. I was just a kid, a 9 yr old kid. Going back home from school, thinking about how I would get to orc town by walking since i never knew about \u201c/join/ command exists. My excitement when im going to open my browser  just to search aq.com, then I would  open youtube just to listen to Moment of Truth while I playing the game. Not caring about rares and such. Being super happy having ninja class and dragonslayer class and thinking i am now the strongest player. Never cared about rares and such, it was only \u201cyeh this weapon has high damage gotta equip it\u201d. It was really a blissful time and now here i am doing an all nighter just to finish my projects. \n\nps: already sold my og account for 25 bucks\n",

            "text": "A couple days ago I made a post on Chaos Avenger and gathered some input from the community on ways to improve the class before it gets released. I also have been looking at a lot of twitter posts under \"@AqwClass\". I'm going to list here all the main problems people seem to have with the class along with my personal input, and I'm going to list some potential solutions I've seen or thought up. \n\n**Problem:**\n\n*The class takes too long to stack*\n\nRight now in order to reach the max damage resistance and heal you need to stack your 4th ability 5 times. This class is a tank class so the reduction is very important and you won't have access to max resistance until 30+ seconds into the fight. This also means if you die in a group fight you will have to spend 30+ seconds trying to reach max resistance and heal again. Because of this, the class has to gamble a bit at the start of tough boss fights and might struggle after it dies in group fights. \n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe stacking requirement to reach max damage resistance should either happen faster or just straight up be removed. I think keeping stacks for the heal is fine as long as the class can survive long enough against hard hitting bosses to make use of it. \n\n**Problem:**\n\n*Heal is too low*\n\nThe heal already needs to be max stacks to be useful, and even at max stacks its not that good. Considering this class is mainly meant to be used for tougher bosses considering its damage reduction and high hp, its important that it at least has a decent heal. \n\n**Solution:**\n\nPretty straightforward solution, just increase the heal. \n\n**Problem:**\n\n*The important debuffs are inconsistent* \n\nThe damage, haste, and hit chance debuffs are the most important to helping you survive and are the least likely to happen. \n\n**Solution:**\n\nMake the damage and hit chance debuffs the most common and the evasion and crit chance debuffs the least common, and have the haste debuff be 50%. This way there is still some randomness but it benefits the survivability of the class more. \n\n**Problem:**\n\n*The class needs to have a unique role*\n\nRight now this class looks like its meant to be a tank class with high dps. The issue with this is that we already have one that is better called \"Void Highlord\". If the class is released as it is now it will just get overshadowed and banked. The class doesn't need to be better than Void Highlord and it shouldn't be,  but it needs to do something different to make it stand out.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe class should have some unique tank ability. This could come in the form of a taunt, reflect, counter, etc. It just needs something to stand out more to make it worth picking up for endgame players. Even if they have to lower the dps to make it happen, it's more important that the class does something different. \n\n**Problem:**\n\n*The class requirement is too much*\n\nThe issue with the class requirement isn't that drakath is too hard to kill, it's the classes required to kill drakath. Right now the standard strategy to kill drakath is to use Void Highlord, Lord of Order, Stone Crusher, and Arch Paladin. This is the best combination accessible to free players to kill the boss. There are other combinations but they are harder to pull off, take more coordination, and take longer. Right now this class is essentially a worse version of Void Highlord and most people are using Void Highlord to get this class. I'm sure the developers want people to use the class when it comes out, but if most of the people acquiring this class have a better alternative then it will get banked. \n\n**Soultion:**\n\nThe solution to this is to either make the class more unique to make it worth it for endgame players, lower the difficulty of drakath, or to change the acquisition method for this class entirely. Personally I think the best option is to just make the class more unique. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWow I pretty much typed a whole essay here. I'm very happy to see another chaos class get released which is why I don't want it to get overshadowed by the other endgame classes after release. I don't expect all of these buffs to happen but it would be great if at least a couple changes happened. This is mainly just to help give the developers some feedback if they happen to see this.\n",

If it doesn't quite reach VHL's level, it will still be unique with the newly-added taunt at the very least.\n\nPersonally, I'm a little disappointed that I just caved and spent my HPs after all this time to get Chrono Commandant in order to get this class easier only for the class to possibly be a better version of Chrono Commandant.

            "text": "I had no time to test it, but I think Timeless/Corrupted Chronomancer can be used in a succesfull attempt against Drakath.\n\nTimeless Chronomancer can have a loopable Focus. You need Entropic Corruption, than press 4 skill. The disadvantage is that Focus is active for 3 seconds. So you need to use 4 as quickly as possible and this does not let you much time to use another skill.\n\nI think TC/CC can be used both for focusing Drakath and to do damage to him (when he is below 2M HP).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy theory for a succesfull attempt against Drakath (if you play as TC/CC) is the following:\n\n1. When Drakath will not nuke, do not use Entropic Corruption (this consumable makes you take 150% more damage).\n2. When Drakath is almost ready to nuke, you will use Entropic Corruption and your 4 skill (Corruption Throught Time) to Focus him\n3. Spam the 4 skill until Drakath nukes you\n4. If Drakath use his final nuke (below 4M HP), you can remain TC/CC and you will focus on dealing as much damage as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. You need to make sure that your endurance is below 3500 (even with endurance buff from AP healing skill or LoO second skill) \\* . You need to die at phase 2 Drakath nukes to not buff himself.\n\n2. Your party should have a healer (AP, LoO, LC, etc.) to heal you. Remember that Entropic Corruption makes you take 150% more damage. \\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I have mentioned, I had not tested this strategy. Let me know if this is a viable strategy. Also I am curious if Drakath has damage cap when he is below 2M HP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*My minimum endurance as TC is 2820 (I have used a level 1 weapon, level 1 helm, level 1 cape and level 51 lucky enhacement). If your endurance is below 3000, you can die at every Drakath nuke, preventing him from buffing himself.\n\n\\*\\*This accentuates the need for Drakath to do as less damage as possible. This can be done by dying at Drakath's nuke.\n",

            "text": "BLoD used to be the only thing to give you +75% damage against a tagged monster, but now AE has made DragonBlade give +75% to Dragonkin and the new Empowered Chaos weapons give +75% to Chaos.\n\nIt seems like only a matter of time before they make weapons that give +75% to Human/Elemental. The new chaos weapon is 10x easier to obtain than BLoD and still much easier than DragonBlade. I don't want to see SDKA left in the dust if a new weapon comes out that boasts +75% Human damage and is as easy to get as the new Chaos boost weapons. \n\nMy suggestion is to either increase SDKA to +75% or create a weapon that is obtainable if you have SDKA that gives +75% (or make it easier to obtain e.g. NSoD). I think straight-up buffing SDKA might be too overpowered because it would mean SDKA + NSoD would give you the highest damage boost in the entire game, but it could be a fun niche against human monsters.\n\nI think it would be a little cheap if SDKA, which is the equivalent in farming time to BLoD, is replaced by a much easier farm.\n",

            "text": "LONG POST AHEAD!!!\n\nAfter returning to the game a year ago, this must be the worst experience I've had with another player. I won't say the username because I simply don't want to give the person clout. \n\nBasically, this person (let's call him Player A) asked for help in /championdrakath. Me being me, I was like, \"What do you need help with?\" So, we went to /dragoncapital and said he needed help with farming for the armor. At this point, the player is kinda sus because he had VHL and what did he even need help with if he had VHL. Said he needed the kills to be faster. I should've left him at this point tbh. But anyways, I stayed because he was gonna help me kill Champion Drakath in return.\n\nSeconds later, another player with almost the same  username as him pops up (let's call this guy Player B). Player A calls Player B his gf and I was like, \"Really?\" I was just laughing at the whole situation and was really weirded out. I knew something was up but I couldn't pinpoint what.\n\nThen, after Player A \"got\" the armor, I thought we were going to /championdrakath but it was Player A's house. I was fine with it but whatever. He left Player B and I alone while he was looking for 2 other players. I asked him if Player B was really Player A's gf and said that Player B was Player A's brother. In my mind, I was like these 2 people must be trolling rn.\n\nAfter that, we got to attempt killing Champion Drakath with the 2 other players he found. It was going smooth the first time but some mishaps happened so we had to reset. At our 2nd attempt, we were so close to 2.5m health and Player A just decided to say in the middle of the fight, \"Sorry guys, I got to go.\" DUDE HAD THE AUDACITY. I had no holds barred at this point. I'm pretty sure the other 3 players I was with were also pissed. \n\nTo the player who did this, I don't know if you were serious or just trolling but if you were a troll, thank you for nothing (really). Thank you for wasting our time dude.\n",

I thought this would be a good time to share this story to inform other users to do the same.\n\nI was outside of the library waiting for a ride from my mom. I was with my friend but his aunt already picked him up so I was alone now. A group of 5 guys came up to me and complimented my Alpha Pirate. I guess they saw me playing AQW on the computers. They asked if I IODAed it but I lied and said I was a 2008 OG. All of a sudden they ask me if they could use my phone to make a call. Now I knew something was up cause they clearly all had phones as I could see it in their pockets. I guess they over heard me telling my friend I kept all my passwords on my notes app. At this point I knew I had to act fast or else I was fucked. I of course refused but one of them flashed a pocket knife ordering me to give it to him. I ran towards back to the library as fast as I could but of course being a dumbfuck I forgot I had a broken leg. I fell and they all grabbed me by my pants. I thought they were just gonna reach in my pockets but they pulled down my pants all the way. They were in the heat of the moment so no homo I guess. Anyways, one of them reached down but to my surprise instead of grabbing the phone he grabbed my foot and aggressively removed my socks. He began slowly sucking my toes while letting out soft but pronounced moans. Immediately another guy started unbuckling my Gucci belt (purchased from Brother Sam) from behind and within 25 seconds of penetration I felt my anus get wet and sticky. They passed my cheeks around like a class attendance sheet and hit me from the back 1 by 1 consecutively for about 9 and a half minutes. After the last guy released his nut one of them said \u201cHey, maybe we should really take his phone\u201d. This is when I knew I had to act before things got bad. I pulled out the loaded glock 19 I had concealed In my calf holster and was able to fend them off with it. When my mom picked me up she asked me why I was smiling so much. Little did she know I just stopped 5 robbers from taking my AQW account, what an amazing day!\n",

Sure it does require some preparation (i.e. scrolls or pots) and maybe the tiniest bit of coordination between players and classes but that's almost as far as it goes. \n\nI'd say the real struggle with this boss was trying to find random people to do it with but after you'd find yourself with a reliable group of people the boss was as easy as you beat it the first time. Doing this boss is more akin to \\[Log on - invite others - join room and accept quest - beat boss -turn in and log off\\] taking a total of almost 10 minutes if you guys are lucky and/or know what your doing. Whilst VHL would take maybe hours doing without pets. Having to log in 15 days+ doing the elder blood daily, farming 200 tainted gems, etc. \n\nThat's just my take on it, as far as I'm concerned this class should just be the ftp equivalent to naval commander or the death-lord-member-class thing. (also not saying it shouldn't be able to solo, it should be just not as fast or to the caliber of VHL as of now).\n\nTLDR; this boss is easy, finding randoms is the only difficult part, VHL supremacy. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qaf4un)\n",

That being said, with the recent massive guild slot increase, **Absolute Alliance** is recruiting! We are looking for members for our three branches: **Absolute Void, Absolute Doom, and Absolute Legion!** Collectively, we are known as **Absolute Alliance!** We are an **Artix Server-based guild!** \n\nIt has been roughly \\~2 years now since the creation of Absolute Alliance, and things have been on an upward swing! Currently, we have over 375 members collectively, with a Discord server population of roughly 700! We have been very fortunate to have found great and, most of all, friendly players! On top of that, we have also partnered up with numerous other guilds! It needs not be said that for the longest time, AE has not taken the proper steps for AQWorlds, be it management to actual gameplay improvement. However, recently, I think we can all say that things are looking on the upside, and I am excited and, dare I say, hopeful that things continue this way! \n\nThat being said, without further ado-\n\nWe are taking the recruiting process a bit slower and upgrading the slots slowly to match demand. Currently, all three branches sit at 150 slots! In the near future, we plan on fully upgrading all three to 225! If the above goes well, our Discord server will have roughly \\~1000 people, thus allowing for there to virtually be someone available 24/7 to talk about AQW or help you if needed! We are excited to embark on this path and hopeful to share this with you guys! \n\nOur recruiting requirements are as follows:  \n1- We are strictly an **anti-botting guild.**  \n2- **We do take attendance.** This is to monitor and ensure that our guild/server is active. However, the attendance requirement is rather lax. As long as you check in **one out of seven days**, you will be free of purging! Check-ins can be done **in-game or on Discord.** It takes less than \\~10 seconds.  \n3- **We do not have any specific level/item/badge requirements.** AA's goal is to create an environment where people can feel comfortable, be it chatting or asking for help. We welcome players of all caliber regardless of their progression in-game. If you are interested, kindly leave a message below/your Discord tag, and one of my Officers or I will get in touch with you as soon as we can!\n\nTwitter link: [https://twitter.com/Absolute\\_AQW/status/1450182720504672256](https://twitter.com/Absolute_AQW/status/1450182720504672256)\n\n[Absolute Alliance Team!](https://preview.redd.it/626wjuw7g9u71.png?width=1133&format=png&auto=webp&s=0074c77b6330e0ea5da3306f31a32c0886448ffd)\n",

            "text": "I have a few suggestions so all people involve can benefit.\n\nRemoval of rare tagged items. Rare items only makes the game dead and boring because this is supposed to be about adventures, quests and storylines. AE should add more storyline maker and not just artists (no hate). There are alot of potential players who like to make storylines.\n\nBadge for interacting/commendations/helping with people. By this is you need to get atleast a certain amount of commends to get the badge. The badge has 1000 ACs in it so if players reach that certain amount they can get the ACs. If AE would implement this, then we might go back to those days when people are eager to chat with each other. But you need to be level 90 to be able to commend a player once so it won't be exploited by trolls and dummies. Also if they already implemented a report button in which a player can only report once then they can also implement this.\n\nAdding more gold rewards on quest defeating Ultra iara. Ultra iara place is so dead. If they can add the gold quest reward then it might be alive again.\n\nPut an exchanging shop for insignias. Like for example, 2 ezrajal insignias for 1 tyndarius insignias. By adding this, there will be no more dead ultra boss place. \n\nAdd an afk-timer to all places and not just ultra bosses like 5 mins only for afk, after that they will be kicked out in the server for idling.\n\n\nIf they can implement this all, it will have a good domino effect to all people.\n",

            "text": "As you may already know CA received a nerf a few hours ago. Basically I will be complaining about that and tell my reasons why this decision wasn't right.\n\n1) The grind requires more than most people realise.\n\nYeah I know that you technically need to defeat champion drakath 4 times and a few other stuff. But what do you need to defeat drakath in the first place? You need to be at least level 80 and own a decent class. Taking this into account and the fact that ultra bosses rewards are quite generous, it isn't insane to expect a good end game class that isn't worse compared to the other ones.\n\n2) This could be the beginning of a new era.\n\nGrinds can undoubtedly be quite tedious in this game (and I haven't even started vhl/lr/nsod). Honestly I enjoyed the mini grind - there was a bit of farming, revisiting the chaos lords was quite nice and I even did a bit of storyline to get to the QoM. Champion drakath is probably the hardest boss out there, but isn't that bad - potions and just a bit of coordination and you shouldn't have too many problems. In contrast, other grinds make you unironically start questioning your life choices which led to you staying countless hours in front of a screen pressing the exact same 3 buttons in order to get some satisfaction. If CA was as good as vhl and other top tier solo classes this could mean that we wouldn't need to witness such grinds anymore.\n\nHonestly, I think that AE has been doing great stuff recently with all this new features and ultra bosses. Maybe it is a bit much to expect them to buff CA, but I genuinely believe that this would be a huge step in the right direction.\n",

            "text": "\n***THE GOOD***\n\n\u2022Music\n\n-*Who did AE hire and where can I personally greet them?*. No joke, the battle theme music for the new event is absolutely ASTONISHING. As a fan of the Rock Music Genre, this goddamn music slaps AND to top it off, it kinda gives you nostalgia of Mount DoomSkull. It brings you back to the years where you are at the foot of the mountain, slaughtering your way until finally, you get to see Drakath.\n\nYou've beaten him before, in another timeline. But now, in doing so again, you get to taste what it TRULY feels like to battle the Champion himself. The score lets you RELIVE the same feeling you had, battling Drakath for the first time. You're stronger now, of course, but so is he.\n\n\u2022The Quest\n\n-I genuinely like the idea where it is required to revisit all Chaos bosses, Locations and fight them again. I know this section could be easily taken for granted, but I just love the thought of reusing these landmarks once again and grind them.\n\nAlthough a little help as to *where* they are won't be bad. I struggle to think who could be the Fragment of the Dragon, when there are like 3 Chaos Dragons.\n\n\u2022The Boss Fight\n\n-Controversial, I know. I have heard complaints about how excruciating this boss is, and how it should be nerfed. And while all those opinions are valid, I personally believe that making Drakath *this* hard is both good and bad, but that's the entire point of this.\n\nIt not meant to be fair, it is not meant to be easy either. This is supposed to be *chaotic* as all hell. I do agree that there are SOME problems with the boss fight, but we'll talk about that later on.\n\n\n***THE BAD***\n\n\u2022Another Artificial Difficulty\n\n-AE got so much praise with their recent Ultrabosses, and they deserve it. However, AE is starting to milk the idea of very difficult Ultrabosses, by making the boss near impossible to kill WITHOUT the right team composition. And while that's not much of an issue, I've seen someone from here say,\n\n\"The only reason they are hard bosses is because they render all other classes useless\"\n\nAnd to that, I agree. A boss with near 100% hit rate would make any dodge class bad, a boss with nuke protection renders high damage classes useless, and so on and so forth. Stop buffing the stats of Bosses, and start making up new mechanics for said bosses: Skills, Abilities, AoE Damage, DoT, all those stuff. Apply those, then buff the stats of the bosses later. I'd much rather fight a boss with many, different abilities, than something with 20m heath.\n\nSo far, the Champion Drakath fight is fine (?) For what he is now. But AE, stop milking them.\n\n\u2022Very Lackluster\n\n-I know the event is supposed to be an anticipation for the new class, but that's honestly about it. There's nothing to grind, nothing to do, no reasons to even stay and fight. The fact that it's a weekly event, only drags things longer than it should. You need A FULL MONTH before you get the class, and by that time the hype would've probably be already dead.\n\nGive us more than just bad merge items (because who in the right mind would buy any of those?). Give us a reason to stay, give us a reason to fight, give us something to remember this event by than just \"Chaos, Boss and Weekly\"\n\n\u2022CA's Nerfs\n\n-Let's be real here, the only reason CA was nerfed wasn't because it was OP, but it's because AE couldn't be bothered to create an actual challenging boss.\n\nI'm not saying the recent bosses have been easy, they've definitely shown their difficulty and it's no joke, but they aren't difficult to kill because they are strong, they are difficult to kill BECAUSE you, as a player, lacks options to play. It's always \"Do you have VHL/SC/LoO/LR/AP\" etc etc. There is no fun, no challenge, no actual reward because the boss, in of itself, is flawed. Like what I said above: They have artificial difficulty.\n\nCA wasn't even as strong as VHL. After the update with the Taunt, it became an ACTUAL option. It wasn't the strongest, never will be, but it had uses. After the nerf, it basically became irrelevant again. I'm not saying the class is bad, it's *probably* still good, but my Bank will not be full anytime soon.\n\n\n\n***THE CHAOS***\n\n\u2022A Wish Granted\n\n-I'm not even sure, but AE had granted the wish of many (MINE INCLUDED) with this update, to the best of their abilities. A Chaos Faction themed update event, with a NEW CHAOS class that seems promising, and a boss so challenging you get cramps. **CRAMPS**. When was the last time playing AQW gave you cramps?!\n\n\n\n[-] I wish I could say more. I love Chaos, ever since as a kid. Overall, the update has been amazing albeit disappointing in some aspects, but it's an improvement for sure. Their saving grace to continue this streak would be Spider, but if a former Bot maker can create this decade old game back to relevancy, surely an entire company could as well, right?\n",

Other \"useful\" classes I have are Chaos Slayer Berserker, Infinite Legion Dark Caster, Legion Doomknight, Glacial Berserker and Royal Vampire Lord. Only useful weapon is Chaorrupter Unlocked. I also can only play on puffin, so sometimes the browser freezes for a few seconds.\n\nContext:\nWell, I've been away for quite some time and I'm seeing the new stuff that I didn't get to play while away. I see a lot of people talking about the new class and the quest gives a ton of things. So, I keep waiting for some people but two problems arise. First is people hop into the room, see there's just me and, instead of , you know, talking or waiting a bit, they just leave. Second there's a lot of stuff like potions and strategies that people seem to have beforehand. Since I dislike people either AFKing or doing this  coming and leaving, I just start fighting Drakath to stack the 1 (Archpaladin) in advance. From what someone was saying, I understood that this doesn't help (?). Other people told me to let one guy die after a certain amount of health (don't know why). Then, my browser froze for a bit, conveniently right at the moment I was supposed to let the guy die anyway, but I shouldn't have(?) and we we're wiped. After, they just left after I said I didn't have other useful classes and told me to make room\n\nI'm a bit salty, I admit, but I know it's my fault for not knowing the strategies. I just wished they at least asked if I knew the procedures before being kinda rude.\n\nI thankful in advance for anyone who helps.\n",

When I go to the story line and click on the boss area, there appears to have one more quest that I supposed to not have done yet? I scoured different threads and I cant get it to move on. Please help :((. Then when I try to go back from the beginning (Bloodtusk) so that I can retrace my step, I always end up getting told to go to The Span. Even the woman (She Who Answers) on either sides tells me to go to the ladies that tells me to go next. I am pretty sure I did the last quest  \"**Choice: Kassandra Confrontation**\" on both sides. Idk why neither of it has that Boss check\n\n Edit: BTW if I go up Mount Doomskull, this ends up the portal thing telling me that I havent defeated all the chaos lords thats why I really need help.

Sometimes it's 2 seconds, and sometimes it's about 5 seconds believe it or not. (Maybe my teams SC was doing a bad job, but I don't think so.)\n\n2. Missing a taunt is a high risk. That others are support with low HP, and they might die. The cool down of the skill makes it so that there is no second chance. This is specially frustrating (and risky) during the last two nukes. \n\n\nThere's a benefit of choosing Chaos Avenger which i mentioned earlier: \n\n1. Chaos Avenger can play as both the DPS and the taunt role without using the potion slot. Since the boss has a damage cap at around 50k it doesn't matter all that much if you run VHL or Chaos Avenger as DPS. \n\nNC into VHL is probably a slightly better option, but it's nice to be able to switch things up.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nI also tested Chaos Avenger vs. 50, 70, 100, and 150k HP bosses, but i didn't test it thoroughly. The class is actually really fast and consistent here, specially if you're killing the same boss multiple times. \n\nI teamed up with VHL, and we roughly matched each other in DPS. VHL would of course win vs. higher HP bosses, and Chaos Avenger would probably win vs. 20k enemies/bosses, although I'm not sure, i'll test that later.\n\nI feel like it's a pretty good class overall, i actually banked my NC instead :')\n",
